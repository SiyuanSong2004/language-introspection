1027,2024-10-27 08:00:12,The four 'dreaded' letters on airline boarding passes that travelers say they never want to see,https://www.foxnews.com/travel/four-dreaded-letters-airline-boarding-passes-travelers-say-never-want-see,Tourism,"Should you panic when you see ""SSSS"" printed on your boarding pass? Social media users are going viral for sharing their experiences after noticing the four letters upon arriving at the airport.

So, what does SSSS mean if it appears when you check in?

""SSSS are indeed four dreaded letters that no traveler should want to see on their boarding pass,"" Zach Griff, senior aviation writer for the New York-based travel blog The Point Guys, told Fox News Digital.

AIRLINE TRAVELER GOES VIRAL FOR MIXING COCKTAIL BEFORE BOARDING A PLANE: IS IT LEGAL?

""It stands for ‘secondary security screening selection,’ and it’s a measure implemented by security authorities in the U.S. to screen certain passengers with additional checks.""

The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) will select passengers before the official flight departure.

""Selectees for this enhanced security are chosen in the days leading up to a flight when airlines share the manifest with U.S. security authorities,"" Griff added.

AIRLINE PASSENGER SAYS SHE RECEIVED 'CREEPIEST' TEXT FROM STRANGER WHO SAW PHONE NUMBER ON HER LUGGAGE TAG

Griff said that most people who receive SSSS before a flight will not be able to check in online, and will receive a printed ticket from an agent — this is exactly what happened to Jordyn Verzera and JT Mocarski, creators of the travel blog ""The Mobile Homie.""""

The travel-content-creating duo from Arizona have shared their experiences on TikTok each time they noticed the four S's on their boarding passes.

Whenever they receive the SSSS on boarding passes and post it on social media, users flood them with questions in the comment section.

Verzera and Mocarski told Fox News Digital about what this additional screening process entails.

The first time Verzera and Mocarski encountered the four letters, only one of them was able to check in before their flight.

AIRLINE PASSENGER'S 'AWKWARD' SEATING ARRANGEMENT GOES VIRAL: 'NEVER GOING TO RECOVER'

Verzera attempted to get her boarding pass on the airline's app, but a notification popped up saying she had to check in with a gate agent, she said.

Verzera said she was confused until she spoke to an agent.

""They had to give me a printed boarding pass. He [Mocarski] could still use his digital one, and then I had to carry this pass around. It was marked and circled, and I had to show it like every step along the way,"" Verzera said.

""Instead of just going through one form of security … you had to get to the gate early, and they did an extra-deep screening when you departed. But where the big thing was, is, once we arrived, we actually ended up having to go through customs … and that was when the really deep search began.""

AIRLINE PASSENGERS COULD BE REMOVED FROM FLIGHTS FOR GOING BAREFOOT: ETIQUETTE EXPERT WEIGHS IN

Verzera said that every item she packed had to be removed from her luggage, including her toiletry items. Those items were then laid out on a conveyor belt where everything was swabbed. Her laptop also had to be turned on in order to go through security.

""It was a little intimidating the first time around,"" she said.

Verzera had to arrive early at the airport to receive her boarding pass and had to wait in line for three hours. She said it took her another hour to go through the additional screening in customs.

Back in April, when Mocarski had gone through the SSSS process in Rome, it was significantly faster, he said.

FLIGHT ATTENDANT GOES VIRAL ON TIKTOK FOR ATTEMPTING TO EASE COMMON FLYING FEAR

""It depends on which country … or which place where you're going, like the severity of the search, what it entails,"" Mocarski told Fox News Digital.

""SSSS can also be entirely random, and there’s no way to know when booking your flight whether you’ll be chosen as SSSS."" — Zach Griff, senior aviation writer for the New York-based travel blog, The Point Guys

Griff agreed with Mocarski's point by adding that it depends on the airport you are in, with some requiring an early arrival and a ""complete paydown."" Some airports may require a ""personalized interview, along with more screening.""

Mocarski thinks social media may have slightly villainized the extra security measure, he said.

""At the end of the day, it's random, like even the TSA agents, it's not like they're picking you. They know the remedies that they have to go through to make sure that they're doing the check,"" Mocarski said.

'AIRPORT TRAY AESTHETIC' GOES VIRAL AS SOME TRAVELERS HALT SECURITY CHECKPOINTS FOR PHOTO OPS

""It's just staying calm and just respecting their time. And they'll be back with you.""



""At the end of the day … they're just doing your job,"" he added. ""They're not there maliciously.""

Griff said you might receive the SSSS for a variety of different reasons: ""suspicious travel patterns like frequent one-way international trips, or many visits to high-risk countries,"" he said.

""SSSS can also be entirely random, and there’s no way to know when booking your flight whether you’ll be chosen as SSSS,"" Griff added.

Verzera said people might be concerned about ""SSSS"" as they feel the extra screening will lead to them missing their flight.

She and Mocarski recommend getting travel insurance for this purpose.

They also said that when ""SSSS"" appeared on their boarding passes, the plane ""waited"" and didn't leave any ""SSSS passengers"" behind.

""I think for us, and something we like to remind our friends of, is that travel isn't perfect,"" Verzera said.

""You grow the most when you're uncomfortable with travel – just understand that this happens. Just roll with it, and just let it be part of your day . . . go through it, and then [say], ‘I hope it never happens again.’""

A TSA spokesperson told Fox News Digital via email that SSSS is meant to accomplish the agency's ""transportation security mission.""

""Security measures begin long before passengers arrive at the airport,"" the spokesperson wrote. ""TSA works closely with the intelligence and law enforcement communities to share information. Additional security measures are in place from the time passengers get to the airport until they arrive at their destination. In some cases, passengers are randomly selected for enhanced screening.""

No traveler is able to bypass the screening, according to the TSA.

If a traveler experiences difficulties getting through the security screening process, they can reach out to the DHS Travel Redress Program for assistance.

Saudi Arabia is channeling billions into transformative mega-projects as part of an ambitious plan to position the nation for future global challenges. These projects are expected to reshape the Saudi economy, create countless job opportunities, and enhance quality of life.

One of the most iconic developments is NEOM, a futuristic city on the Red Sea coast envisioned as a hub for sustainability and innovation. With an anticipated investment of $500 billion (£386bn), Saudi leaders aim for NEOM to draw talent from across the globe to live and work in this next-generation urban center.

Riyadh is also making bold moves to expand its tourism sector, moving beyond a reliance on oil and gas. One standout project is The Red Sea Project, a high-end tourism development on Saudi Arabia’s west coast in Tabuk province, stretching across a vast 28,000-square-kilometer area between Umluj and Al-Wajh. Featuring more than 90 pristine offshore islands, 200 km of Red Sea coastline, and diverse landscapes including beaches, mountains, deserts, and even volcanoes, this project promises a unique luxury escape.

Launched by Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman in 2017 as part of the Saudi Vision 2030 initiative, The Red Sea Project is set to transform Saudi tourism. Upon completion in 2030, it will offer 50 hotels, 8,000 rooms, and over 1,000 residential units spread across 22 islands and six inland locations.

As of 2024, five resort sites are operational, including two inland and three island-based destinations. In May, Ritz-Carlton unveiled the Nujuma resort on the Ummahat Islands, where it joins the luxurious St. Regis Red Sea Resort. Known for its exclusivity, Nujuma has become the Middle East’s most lavish hotel, with nightly rates around £2,627, adding a new level of luxury to Saudi Arabia’s emerging tourism landscape."

Sri Lanka’s tourism faces a setback as travel advisories raise safety concerns in key regions, impacting a sector vital for economic recovery this winter season.

The recent developments have cast a shadow on Sri Lanka’s tourism industry, a sector that was beginning to see promising signs of recovery. This year, the country’s tourism sector showcased resilience despite challenges, managing to report steady arrival numbers amid a turbulent political transition. However, with the winter season just around the corner, a fresh set of obstacles has emerged, threatening to dampen the anticipated tourism boom that many in the industry had been counting on to offset the economic setbacks caused by COVID-19, the Easter Sunday attacks, and other crises.

Arugam Bay, known for its world-class surfing conditions, has become a focal point of concern following a series of travel advisories issued by multiple countries. Israelis, who form a substantial part of the region’s tourist demographic, have been alerted to potential security threats, prompting countries like the U.S., U.K., Israel, Australia, and Russia to advise caution. Local authorities in Sri Lanka had been aware of possible security risks since early October but opted for a strategic approach to avoid public alarm. Minister of Public Security Vijitha Herath addressed the matter, confirming that the government, under presidential oversight, had taken all necessary security precautions across Arugam Bay and other key tourist areas like Ella and Mirissa.

Impact on Sri Lanka’s Tourism Recovery

Tourism is a lifeline for Sri Lanka, contributing significantly to employment and foreign exchange reserves. For local hoteliers, restaurateurs, and tour operators, the winter season represents a golden opportunity to recover from previous losses. The arrival of international visitors, including surfers and beachgoers, traditionally boosts the sector during this period. Unfortunately, the timing of the travel advisories couldn’t be worse, as the season had shown encouraging signs of a comeback.

The mention of potential violence reignites painful memories of the 2019 Easter Sunday attacks, a traumatic event for the country that shook confidence in Sri Lanka’s safety as a tourist destination. In the wake of these attacks, Sri Lanka’s domestic tourism industry witnessed significant downturns, with lingering concerns about safety that continue to surface in media coverage abroad. The government’s failure to act on reliable intelligence during the Easter Sunday events, coupled with political infighting and slow action on investigation findings, has led to continued scrutiny.

International Travel Advisories: A Blow to Confidence

Following the recent travel advisories, local authorities had no choice but to acknowledge the security concerns. The U.S. was the first to issue a travel advisory, quickly followed by several other nations. This move forced Sri Lankan authorities to break their silence, with the National Security Council reportedly holding several meetings to address the issue. Local officials hope the visible security measures will restore confidence, particularly among tourists currently in Arugam Bay. For now, visitors are still seen enjoying the beaches, with many expressing a lack of concern over the news in televised interviews. However, industry stakeholders remain apprehensive about the long-term effects of this incident on visitor numbers.

Challenges from Within: Sri Lanka’s Political Landscape

Complicating matters further is Sri Lanka’s domestic political landscape. The government is caught in the crossfire of political tensions as the opposition leader, Sajith Premadasa of the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB), positions himself as a prime ministerial candidate in the upcoming elections. The country’s recent history of absolute majorities, notably in the 1970 and 1977 elections, has led to concerns about potential power imbalances, and analysts like Rajan Philips highlight the critical need for balanced governance. The upcoming elections have set the stage for a new round of political rhetoric, with certain factions seizing on the recent security concerns to criticize the current administration’s handling of safety issues.

The ongoing political maneuvering has exacerbated public concerns, with opposition figures questioning recent police appointments and the government’s response to national security. Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith and the Catholic Church have openly criticized the government’s lack of action regarding the findings from the Presidential Commission of Inquiry into the Easter attacks, further fueling public distrust.

Arugam Bay: The Epicenter of Attention

The media attention surrounding Arugam Bay underscores the extent of the concern. Known for its allure as a surf destination, this coastal area attracts adventure-seeking tourists from across the globe, especially from Israel. Israeli tourists, in particular, have long been drawn to Arugam Bay’s waves, and Israeli media have frequently spotlighted the destination. In fact, a popular Israeli film depicted two soldiers on holiday in Arugam Bay, which introduced many Israeli travelers to the area’s unique charm.

While the surf season at Arugam Bay is nearing its end, stakeholders are worried that the recent security alerts could impact tourist arrivals not only there but also in other southern destinations. With reports of potential threats, it’s uncertain whether Israeli tourists and other international visitors will opt for alternative travel plans, possibly avoiding Sri Lanka altogether in the coming season.

Tourism’s Economic Role and the Ripple Effect of Warnings

Tourism in Sri Lanka does not solely cater to leisure travelers. A recent trend has seen Russians and Ukrainians staying longer in the country, often to avoid military service in their home countries. Some have even established small, informal businesses. The country’s reliance on tourism as a key driver of economic stability means that any drop in tourist numbers could have a domino effect on local communities, particularly in popular destinations such as Ella and Mirissa, known for their vibrant hospitality and adventure tourism sectors.

The current circumstances present Sri Lanka with a challenging conundrum. Reassuring potential tourists about safety is paramount, but the tourism industry also faces the hurdle of convincing international markets that these alerts are based on caution, not necessarily immediate threat. Security measures implemented by the Sri Lankan government aim to maintain a visible presence, but travel advisories carry significant weight in influencing travelers’ decisions.

Looking Ahead: Preparing for the Winter Tourism Season

As the winter season approaches, many in the industry are left wondering about the outlook for Sri Lankan tourism. While the country has shown resilience in rebounding from past challenges, this recent spate of warnings underscores the need for proactive measures in building long-term confidence. Stakeholders suggest that consistent communication from tourism authorities and collaboration with international agencies could play a crucial role in mitigating the fallout from these advisories.

The upcoming parliamentary elections will also serve as a pivotal moment, potentially impacting Sri Lanka’s image and tourism policy. With campaigns in full swing, it remains to be seen if a stable political outcome will offer a respite to a tourism industry striving for stability.

A Resilient Tourism Sector

Despite the challenges, Sri Lanka’s tourism sector has a history of bouncing back. The resilience of its people, combined with the natural beauty of destinations like Arugam Bay, Ella, and Mirissa, has consistently drawn visitors back. While travel advisories may slow momentum in the short term, the country’s rich cultural heritage, diverse landscapes, and warm hospitality continue to appeal to travelers worldwide. As Sri Lanka moves forward, its tourism industry remains hopeful for a prosperous winter season, driven by the efforts of dedicated local businesses and government initiatives aimed at ensuring safety and stability.

As the world watches Sri Lanka navigate this new challenge, its tourism industry stands as a testament to the country’s enduring appeal. The sector’s ability to overcome crises—whether political, economic, or security-related—offers a glimmer of hope for the future, even as it faces one of its most critical tests yet."

With Turkey off-limits, Israelis turn to Thessaloniki for a nearby escape filled with rich history, Jewish heritage, and Mediterranean charm by the sea.

With Turkey essentially off-limits for Israeli tourists since October 7, 2023, nearby Greece has rapidly gained prominence, with Thessaloniki emerging as the go-to destination. Already a popular choice among Israeli travelers, Thessaloniki, a northern coastal city, offers an appealing mix of history, culture, and convenience. With direct flights from Ben-Gurion Airport via numerous airlines, the city presents an ideal getaway for those seeking an enriching travel experience close to home.

Located along the Thermaic Gulf, Thessaloniki has drawn visitors with its impressive 2,300-year-old history, captivating sea views, and significant Jewish heritage. Not only does the city offer picturesque views and shopping, but its layered history and resilient Jewish story create a unique connection for Israeli tourists.

Uncovering Thessaloniki’s Rich History and Jewish Legacy

Thessaloniki has a profound historical narrative, particularly within its central district. It is here that Jewish life thrived for over five centuries, a time when the city was the only one in Europe with a Jewish majority. Tragically, this era ended with the devastation of World War II, where 96% of Thessaloniki’s Jewish community was wiped out. The city’s Jewish history traces back to the 4th century BCE, starting from the city’s founding by Alexander the Great, who named it after his half-sister.

The Jewish community in Thessaloniki expanded significantly following the expulsion of Jews from Spain in 1492, with approximately 20,000 Spanish Jews finding refuge in the city. This era brought prosperity and intellectual contributions, including the works of Kabbalist Rabbi Shlomo Halevi Alkabetz, whose poem “Lecha Dodi” remains integral to Friday night prayers across the Jewish world.

Today, visitors can explore the remnants of this rich heritage at the Yad Lezikaron Synagogue and the Jewish Community Center. The center’s left wall displays the names of the once-thriving synagogues that existed before the city was heavily damaged by the 1917 fire and the Holocaust. The Monastir Synagogue, the only one that survived the war, is a poignant reminder of Thessaloniki’s resilience and hosts significant Jewish events today.

A memorial sculpture on the seafront honors the 50,000 Jews deported during the Nazi occupation, with a Holocaust museum underway. At the site of what was once Europe’s largest Jewish cemetery, where over 350,000 graves lay, stands the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. Here, another sculpture offers a solemn tribute to the city’s Jewish community, preserving their memory for all who visit.

Experiencing Thessaloniki’s Vibrant Waterfront and Social Life

Staying at the Teight Hotel, located just 50 meters from Thessaloniki’s famous seafront, visitors are immediately immersed in the vibrant local scene. The city’s boardwalk, lined with cafes offering panoramic sea views, serves as a social hotspot. On a clear day, Mount Olympus towers on the horizon, a magnificent backdrop for leisurely strolls along the coast.

Thessaloniki’s downtown area is remarkably walkable, centered around Aristotle Square, a vibrant hub where locals and visitors alike gather. The square’s design is intriguing, shaped like a long wine bottle with streets crisscrossing around it, inviting explorers to discover the nearby shops and cafes.

One of the most popular activities in Thessaloniki is a ride on a mock pirate ship that ferries tourists around the port. Departing from the dock opposite the iconic White Tower, these tours offer stunning views of the coastline. The White Tower, originally known as the Red Tower due to its violent past, provides breathtaking 360-degree views across the bay from the top, accessible via a broad spiral staircase.

Authentic Culinary and Market Experiences in Thessaloniki

Thessaloniki’s downtown outdoor market offers an Aladdin’s cave of goods, particularly for food lovers. Here, you’ll find locally produced olive oils, wines, and strong spirits displayed in traditional steel Greek urns. For an insightful shopping experience, ask for Alexandra, a local vendor known for her welcoming nature and extensive knowledge of the market’s offerings, shared in perfect English.

Among the city’s many culinary delights, Estrella stands out as an all-day brunch destination. Known for its decadent egg dishes and irresistible desserts, this restaurant is a favorite among both locals and tourists. For a more upscale dining experience, head to Moldee, a restaurant near the waterfront renowned for its seasonal menu crafted from locally-sourced ingredients.

Walking Through Thessaloniki’s Historic and Sacred Sites

One of Thessaloniki’s most significant religious landmarks is the Holy Church of Saint Demetrius, named after the city’s patron saint. This impressive church commemorates Demetrius’s martyrdom under the Roman Empire, an event that holds special significance in the city’s history. The church’s underground area, now a museum, houses artifacts and exhibits detailing its use over the centuries as a bathhouse, prison, and storage facility.

The city is also rich with historic monasteries and vine-covered pathways, particularly around the ancient city walls in the upper town. A short taxi ride brings you to these towering walls, offering a panoramic view of Thessaloniki and a sense of its growth from a small city in the 11th century to a bustling metropolis in 2024.

Warm Greek Hospitality and Embracing the Local Culture

One of Thessaloniki’s greatest charms is its people, who greet visitors with warmth and friendliness. While most people under the age of 60 speak some English, greeting them with a cheerful “kaliméra” can earn you a friendly smile. In typical Greek fashion, don’t be surprised if you’re invited to join in on a glass of ouzo while engaging in lively conversation with locals.

Thessaloniki embodies a Mediterranean charm that resonates with Israelis, often evoking a sense of home. Whether it’s the architecture reminiscent of Haifa, the vibrant streets like those in Tel Aviv, or the locally-owned stores similar to those in Jerusalem, there is a familiar comfort that welcomes Israelis to Thessaloniki.

Connecting with the Local Jewish Community

Thessaloniki’s modern Jewish community may be smaller today, with around 1,000 residents, but they remain active and vibrant. The community hosts regular events and offers facilities such as a Jewish school, a kosher senior residence, and a small yet growing Israeli presence. For Israeli visitors, Thessaloniki provides an ideal blend of familiar culture and Mediterranean hospitality, exemplified by the presence of an active Chabad center and a kosher restaurant within the Astoria Hotel.

Exploring Thessaloniki’s Blend of Tradition and Modernity

Thessaloniki offers the best of both worlds, from historical landmarks to a thriving modern culture. Its historic synagogues, vibrant markets, and breathtaking seafront create a unique travel experience for Israelis looking to explore the Mediterranean. As night falls, the city’s picturesque views and the distant silhouette of Mount Olympus evoke a deep sense of awe, making Thessaloniki a memorable destination.

Whether travelers are intrigued by the city’s rich Jewish history, enticed by the lively seafront, or charmed by the friendly locals, Thessaloniki is a place of discovery and connection. For Israelis seeking a nearby destination with a deep historical resonance and a welcoming atmosphere, Thessaloniki is quickly becoming the perfect choice.

Embrace Thessaloniki – A Mediterranean Gem for Israeli Travelers

As more Israelis look for alternative travel destinations close to home, Thessaloniki is ready to welcome them with open arms. Its scenic beauty, profound historical roots, and friendly community offer an unparalleled experience for those seeking both relaxation and enrichment. Embrace the allure of Thessaloniki and discover why this Mediterranean gem feels like home, even when you’re miles away."

Dubai’s Global Village offers unique experiences for all, but knowing key rules—like dress codes and entry guidelines—ensures a smooth and memorable visit.

Each year, Dubai’s Global Village festival park draws millions of locals and international tourists. Open during Dubai’s cooler season starting in October, this vibrant attraction closes just before the summer heat intensifies.

Whether it’s the unique flavors, the retail therapy, or the lively atmosphere with fireworks and carnival games, Global Village has something for everyone. But before you go, here are some guidelines to keep in mind:

Outside Food and Drinks

Bringing food and beverages purchased elsewhere is not allowed in the park. If you’ve grabbed a snack or drink on the way, be sure to finish it and dispose of any waste before entering. Only Display UAE Flags

While Global Village celebrates international culture across 30 pavilions, only the UAE flag is allowed to be displayed. Visitors carrying or waving other national flags may be politely asked to put them away. No Large Bags or Luggage

As a hotspot for travelers, some may have suitcases with them; however, large luggage is not permitted inside. Bags are screened through security checks, including X-ray scanning. Dress Respectfully

Visitors are expected to dress modestly. Both men and women should ensure that shoulders, knees, and torso are covered as a sign of respect for local customs. No Wheels Allowed

Although the park is spacious, scooters, bicycles, roller skates, and skateboards are not allowed unless rented within the park premises. This helps ensure the safety and comfort of all visitors. Leave Pets at Home

Pets, from cats and dogs to more exotic animals, are not allowed inside Global Village. It’s best to leave your furry (or scaly) friends at home for this outing. Limit Public Displays of Affection

Global Village is family-friendly and welcoming to couples, but displays of affection, like hugging and kissing, are best kept private out of respect for local culture and the many young visitors around. Permits for Professional Filming

While casual photos and videos are allowed, those filming for media, social platforms, or student projects must obtain a permit in advance, accessible through the Global Village website."

Discover how Saudi Arabia‘s focus on wellness tourism is accelerating its Vision 2030 goals, boosting the economy and enhancing lifestyles.

As Saudi Arabia advances its Vision 2030 objectives, it steadily cements its position as a global tourism hub, with a strategic emphasis on wellness tourism. The Kingdom’s tourism sector is crucial for economic diversification, job creation, and enhancing life quality. Originally targeting 100 million visitors by 2030, Saudi Arabia achieved this goal seven years early, prompting a revised goal of 150 million visitors by the end of the decade.

This success is attributed to the relentless efforts by the Ministry of Tourism and the Saudi Tourism Authority, which have developed a comprehensive National Tourism Strategy and tapped into burgeoning tourism trends.

Wellness Tourism Defined

Wellness tourism involves traveling to various locales globally to enhance health and well-being through activities that promote a healthy lifestyle, alleviate stress, prevent diseases, and boost overall wellness.

This sector is growing, supporting wellness businesses like spas, retreats, and boot camps. It also encompasses yoga studios, gyms, fitness centers, health-focused stores, and cultural activities, contributing to the expanding wellness economy. According to the Global Wellness Institute, wellness tourism currently holds a global market value of $651 billion, expected to grow annually by 16.6% until 2027.

Wellness Initiatives in Saudi Arabia

In Saudi Arabia, wellness tourism is prioritized to boost GDP contributions from 3% to 10% by 2030. The Kingdom is keen on enhancing its global appeal by providing quality wellness experiences to meet increasing market demand.

Economic Impact

Wellness tourism is integral to Vision 2030, aiming to increase the non-oil GDP and stabilize the Kingdom economically amidst global shifts. This sector’s growth, exemplified by the development of luxury wellness resorts in Riyadh and the Red Sea region, aims to double Riyadh’s visitor numbers from 13.6 million in 2022 to 27.4 million by 2030.

Investments in this sector are likely to generate numerous jobs, particularly within hospitality, healthcare, and wellness industries.

Investment Highlights in Wellness Tourism

Saudi Arabia is enhancing its wellness tourism landscape with offerings like AMAALA, known for its luxury wellness experiences, and natural springs in Al Ahsa. The Red Sea Global (RSG) is spearheading several flagship projects, making the Kingdom a nexus for luxury and sustainable tourism.

AMAALA is pioneering with high-tech, traditional health practices and inclusive wellness programs, including male-specific retreats. Plans include constructing 79 hotels along the Red Sea, anticipated to contribute $8.79 billion annually to the economy upon completion.

Luxurious Wellness Destinations

Saudi Arabia boasts an array of opulent wellness resorts. AMAALA stands out as a leading wellness destination, and the Six Senses Southern Dunes along the Red Sea merges nature, wildlife, and culture in a breathtaking desert setting. The St. Regis Red Sea Resort offers serenity on a secluded island, while Nujuma, a Ritz-Carlton Reserve, marries natural beauty with rich cultural heritage for a memorable wellness experience.

AlUla Wellness Festival

The AlUla Wellness Festival, an annual event held at a prominent Saudi heritage site, promotes physical and mental well-being through a rich array of activities, including yoga, meditation, and unique wellness experiences. The 2024 festival, running from October 17 to November 2, focuses on relaxation and self-reconnection, featuring attractions like the Five Senses Sanctuary and Hegra Sound Bath."

Teachers report thinking that if girls do better in math than boys, it is probably because of their innate ability and effort. But they also report that when boys do well in math, it is more likely due to parental support and society’s higher expectations for their success.

That’s what we discovered from 400 elementary and middle school math teachers we surveyed across the country for our new study. The purpose of the study was to learn more about how teachers explain students’ success and failure in math. We found that the variation in views among educators is not limited to the gender of students. Teachers also hold contrasting views about math performance when it comes to students’ race and ethnicity, our study found. More specifically, we found that when Black and Hispanic students outperform Asian and white students, teachers are more likely to think it’s because of effort and differences in their cognitive abilities. In contrast, when Asian and white students outperform others, teachers attribute it to the support and expectations of others, such as from parents and society, as well as cultural differences that value math learning.

To reach these conclusions, we conducted an experiment. In the experiment, teachers were first asked to help us by reviewing student responses to items on a math test we were developing. After they rated the student responses, we randomly assigned teachers to conditions telling them that one group—either boys or girls, Black and Hispanic or Asian and white—performed better on this test. Then, we asked the teachers to rate their agreement with a set of potential explanations for the disparity. These potential explanations included statements such as “Boys often pay more attention and follow directions in class compared with girls.” After teachers had rated their agreement with these explanations, we asked them about their personal beliefs and experiences with gender and racial discrimination in math classrooms. We analyzed how these beliefs related to their explanations of performance differences. We found that teachers were more likely to attribute the success of girls and Black and Hispanic students to internal factors, such as ability and effort, whereas they were more likely to attribute boys’ and Asian and white students’ success to external factors, such as parental involvement and cultural differences.

The ceremony is set for 3 p.m. on Friday, Nov. 8, at the site of the new animal shelter, next to the Burke County 911 Center on Kirksey Drive in Morganton.

The groundbreaking was originally set for Oct. 4 but had to be rescheduled due to Hurricane Helene.

The county’s new EMS headquarters will sit on 4 acres at the corner of Drexel Road and South Sterling Street in Morganton. The building will be a little less than 14,000 square feet. It will replace the current EMS base No. 1 that sits behind UNC Health Blue Ridge in Morganton.

The new animal shelter will be located at 636 Kirksey Drive, Morganton.

The shelter will be around 15,000 square feet, which will more than double the capacity for animals. The shelter will have the capacity for 36 dogs and 44 cats. The current animal shelter holds 16 dog kennels and 24 cat cages, according to animal services.

At its October meeting, the Burke County Board of Commissioners approved a bid of $13.5 million to Beam Construction Company Inc. for the construction of both facilities. The cost of the EMS headquarters is $6.1 million and the cost of the shelter is $7.3 million, according to the county.

County officials say construction on the projects could take between a year to 18 months."
1029,2024-10-29 08:08:59,Trump press conference today: Trump calls NYC rally a lovefest – NECN,https://www.necn.com/decision-2024/trump-press-conference-today-msg-rally-lovefest/3373328/,Politics,"Urged by some allies to apologize for racist comments made by speakers at his weekend rally, Donald Trump took the opposite approach on Tuesday, saying it was an “honor to be involved” in such an event and calling the scene a “lovefest” — the same term he has used to describe the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.

Trump gathered supporters and reporters to his Mar-a-Lago resort two days after a massive rally at Madison Square Garden featured a number of crude remarks by various speakers, including a set by comedian Tony Hinchcliffe in which he joked that Puerto Rico was a “floating island of garbage.” Some of Trump’s top Republican allies have condemned the remarks, and his campaign took the rare step of publicly distancing itself from Hinchcliffe’s joke, though not the other comments.

But given the opportunity to apologize at multiple events and in interviews Tuesday, Trump instead leaned in. Speaking at his Florida resort, he said that “there’s never been an event so beautiful” as his Sunday rally in his hometown of New York.

“The love in that room. It was breathtaking,” he said. “It was like a lovefest, an absolute lovefest. And it was my honor to be involved.”

On Tuesday night, he told Fox News' Sean Hannity that he knows nothing about Hinchcliffe but said, “I can’t imagine it’s a big deal.” He later agreed, though, that “probably he shouldn’t have been there.”

With just a week before Election Day, some Trump allies have voiced alarm that the rally, which was supposed to highlight the Republican presidential nominee’s closing message in grand New York fashion, has instead served as a distraction and even a liability, given the electoral importance of Puerto Ricans who live in Pennsylvania and other key swing states.

“This is not a time to have anyone criticize Puerto Rico or Latinos,” former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, who challenged Trump for the GOP presidential nomination and later endorsed him, said in an interview with Fox News Channel.

Trump later held a rally in Allentown, Pennsylvania, a city with a large Hispanic population, where Puerto Rico’s shadow U.S. senator, Zoraida Buxo, joined him and defended the former president's record.

“We need this man to be our commander in chief,” said Buxo, who cannot vote in the Senate because Puerto Rico is not a state. “He will make us feel safe and he will protect us.”

Still, there was anger in Allentown. Ivet Figueroa, 61, stood outside the rally venue holding a trash can with the words “Trash Trump” on it.

She said of the insult and Trump:: “The person who said it was vetted by him. So that’s what he allowed, so he has to take responsibility for what he said. Now it’s too late for saying ‘sorry.’ I don’t want an apology, I want justice, and justice is on Nov. 5.”

The fallout from the Madison Square Garden event risked highlighting voters’ concerns about Trump’s rhetoric and penchant for controversy in the closing stretch as both campaigns are scrambling for votes. Speakers at the rally also made racist comments targeting Latinos, Black people, Jews and Palestinians, along with sexist insults directed at Trump’s Democratic rival, Vice President Kamala Harris, and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.

In an interview with ABC News earlier Tuesday, Trump claimed to not know Hinchcliffe but did not denounce what he said.

“I don’t know him. Someone put him up there. I don’t know who he is,” Trump said, according to the network, insisting that he hadn’t heard Hinchcliffe’s comments. When asked what he made of them, Trump “did not take the opportunity to denounce them, repeating that he didn’t hear the comments,” ABC reported.

In the Hannity interview, Trump said people were trying to make the comedian's appearance into a “big deal” when it “has nothing to do with the party, has nothing to do with us.”

Asked later in the interview whether he wished the comic wasn't there, Trump said, “Yeah, I mean I don’t know if it’s a big deal or not, but I don’t want anybody making nasty jokes or stupid jokes."" He added, “Probably he shouldn’t have been there, yeah.”

Later Tuesday, President Joe Biden, on a call organized by the Hispanic advocacy group Voto Latino, denounced the comic's joke and said, “The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters."" He later tried to clarify his comment, saying he was talking about “the hateful rhetoric about Puerto Rico spewed by Trump’s supporter.”

The comments from the Madison Square Garden rally have drawn outrage from Puerto Rican leaders.

The archbishop of Puerto Rico called on Trump to disavow them, saying it wasn’t enough for the campaign to say the joke didn't reflect Trump’s views. The president of Puerto Rico’s Republican Party called the “poor attempt at comedy” by Hinchcliffe “disgraceful, ignorant and totally reprehensible.”

In Pennsylvania, where Trump campaigned Tuesday night, the Latino eligible voter population has nearly tripled since 2000. More than half of those are Puerto Rican voters.

Angelo Ortega, a longtime Allentown resident and former Republican who’s planning to vote for Harris, said he couldn’t believe what he’d heard about Trump’s rally.

“I don’t know if my jaw dropped or I was just so irritated, angry. I didn’t know what to feel,” said Ortega, who was born in New York but whose father came from Puerto Rico. Ortega has been campaigning for Harris and said he knows of at least one Hispanic GOP voter planning to switch from Trump to Harris as a result of Hinchcliffe’s comments.

“They’ve had it. They’ve had it. They were listening to (Trump), but they said they think that that was like the straw that broke the camel’s back,” said Ortega, a member of the Make the Road PA advocacy group.

Still, some voters of Puerto Rican descent weren't fazed. Maricelis Torres, 24, a waitress studying to be a radiologist, waited to get into the Allentown rally and said she and her family laughed at Hinchcliffe's joke.

“If you don’t understand humor, then that’s what I’m saying, people are way too soft these days,” said Torres, whose father is from the island.

The Harris campaign has released an ad that will run online in battleground states targeting Puerto Rican voters and highlighting the comedian’s remarks.

At a roundtable outside Philadelphia on Tuesday afternoon, Trump got some praise from a retired occupational therapist from Puerto Rico, Maribel Valdez. “Puerto Rico stands behind you, and Puerto Rico loves you,” Valdez told him.

Trump thanked her and reminisced about his administration’s efforts to help the island after storms. “I think no president has ever done more for Puerto Rico than I have,” responded Trump, who delayed the release of billions of dollars in assistance to repair years-old hurricane damage in Puerto Rico until shortly before the 2020 election."

Now, the costume nose is headed for the auction block next month, part of a lot of about 350 props, awards, and other items that are being sold by the late actor's estate and his widow, fellow actor Dame Joan Plowright, reports the Guardian .

The prominent prosthetic comes in a box accompanied by a note that indicates Olivier may have received it as an 80th birthday gift from one of the film's makeup artists. ""Dear Larry, We have both made 80. Happy Birthday,"" reads the missive. ""Here is the first nose we used in Spain. Remember you would not shoot on the 13th."" The costume accessory is expected to fetch nearly $2,000.

""I wanted to look the most evil thing there was,"" Olivier said of the prosthetic in his mid-'80s book On Acting. Other items in the auction include the crown props he wore during his various Shakespearean performances, as well as the Golden Globe he won for 1948's Hamlet, his personalized leather script-holder, and ""rare, personal photographs, fine art, keepsakes, and other significant memorabilia"" from him and Plowright, per Julien's Auctions.

""The campaign’s No. 1 priority and the party’s priority right now is getting our people out to vote,"" Jimmy Keady, the founder and president of Republican consulting firm JLK Political Strategies, told Fox News Digital.

The comments come with just one week to go in a dramatic election season, with just a handful of battleground states in play that will decide the fate of the race.

MICHIGAN CAMPAIGN STOPS FROM PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES ALREADY DOUBLE THAT OF 2020, 2016

Perhaps the most important of those states is Michigan, a swing state that narrowly went to Donald Trump in 2016 before flipping back to Joe Biden in another close race in the 2020 election.

Polls indicate yet another tight race brewing in the state, with the RealClearPolitics polling average showing a razor-thin 0.1 point lead for Trump as of Monday. Meanwhile, the latest Fox News Power Rankings lists Michigan as a toss-up, and Trump is only a slight betting favorite in the state, with ElectionBettingOdds.com showing the former president with a 53.2% chance of carrying the state as of Monday.

According to Keady, the part of the race in which candidates attempt to persuade voters is mostly over, with Michigan coming down to who has the ground game to get the numbers out between now and next Tuesday. Republicans will also be focused on turning out low propensity voters, Keady said, a demographic the party has targeted in the hopes the group could potentially push them over the top.

""A lot of these campaigns are going to be focused a lot on low propensity voters … voters that are voting in like one out of four elections, making sure that they’re hit several times, making sure we’re dragging people out to the polls to vote,"" Keady said.

CHECK OUT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POWER RANKINGS IN THE 2024 ELECTION

Jason Roe, a GOP strategist working in Michigan, echoed a similar sentiment, telling Fox News Digital that the time to persuade undecided voters is mostly over.

""There’s not a lot of undecided voters left, but there’s untapped voters who've never heard from a Republican campaign,"" Roe said. ""In addition to getting mail-in ballots returned and people to vote early, finding and mobilizing low propensity voters and getting them to the polls is everyone’s focus.""

Keady also believes that such a strategy could help down-ballot Republicans in Michigan, where races such as the Senate campaign between former Republican Rep. Mike Rogers and Democrat Rep. Elissa Slotkin will help determine which party controls the Senate.

""Michigan and Nevada are one of two of the seven swing states on the map that basically have straight ticket voting,"" Keady said. ""Getting low prop voters out to vote that are Republican and conservative means it’s going to help down-ballot.""

POLITICAL ROCK STARS AND ENTERTAINMENT CELEBRITIES HIT THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL

That optimism is shared by Rogers himself, who told Fox News Digital that issues such as the ""open border, job-killing EV mandates and rising gas and grocery prices"" will help motivate voters out to the polls in hopes of avoiding ""more of the same.""

""Over the next week, Team Rogers will be burning the shoe leather to earn every vote,"" Rogers said. ""We will be hosting numerous rallies and stops across Michigan sharing our message of getting America back on track.""

Keady also noted another opportunity unique to Michigan in the battle to get blue-collar and union voters out to the polls with just a week to go.

""We are seeing a lot of union members move to the Republican side because of their economic policies … particularly when it comes to manufacturing jobs,"" Keady said. ""The campaigns absolutely have to be moving through their microtargets and talking to these union voters."""

Alaska Air Group (NYSE: ALK) has released its financial results for the third quarter ending September 30, 2024, highlighting a successful quarter that includes the recent acquisition of Hawaiian Airlines. In this high-performing quarter, Alaska Air Group led the industry in adjusted pretax margins and reported significant profit gains.

Alaska Air Group completed its acquisition of Hawaiian Airlines on September 18, 2024. This integration of networks, service strengths, and regional expertise aims to create a more resilient airline group in a competitive industry. CEO Ben Minicucci commented, “We are excited to bring together the strengths of both Alaska and Hawaiian Airlines, creating an industry-leading carrier capable of navigating challenges and capitalizing on new opportunities.”

Financial Performance Highlights

Alaska Air Group reported a GAAP pretax margin of 10.7% and earnings per share (EPS) of $1.84 for the quarter. Excluding special items, the adjusted pretax margin was 13.0%, positioning Alaska Air Group as the industry leader. For the period ending September 30, Alaska Air Group’s consolidated results included approximately 13 days of Hawaiian Airlines’ performance, adding substantial value to the combined company’s results.

Alaska Air Group recorded GAAP net income of $236 million or $1.84 per share. Excluding special items and fuel hedge accounting, adjusted net income rose to $289 million or $2.25 per share, well above initial guidance of $1.40 to $1.60.

Revenue and Market Trends

The airline reported positive revenue growth driven by a steady increase in bookings, with particular strength in the Pacific Northwest and Latin American regions. Corporate travel demand rebounded in September and into October, showing growth of 9% year-over-year, largely due to increased activity from the technology and professional services sectors. First and premium class revenue outpaced the main cabin, growing by 10% and 8%, respectively, year-over-year.

Looking to the fourth quarter, Alaska Air Group anticipates revenue per available seat mile (RASM) to rise from low single-digit growth to mid-single-digit gains, supported by continued demand across its network.

Strategic Acquisition of Hawaiian Airlines

The integration of Hawaiian Airlines is expected to drive new opportunities for growth and market penetration. Hawaiian Airlines’ performance improved over the quarter, with positive North American RASM (revenue per available seat mile) and year-over-year advancements in international routes. Notably, Hawaiian’s EBITDAR turned positive in Q2 and is anticipated to reach breakeven by Q4 2024.

Upcoming Investor Day

Alaska Air Group is set to host its Investor Day on December 10, 2024, where executives will share the long-term strategic vision for the combined airline. This includes the potential for expanded synergies, margin growth, and free cash flow projections for 2025. Given the proximity of the Investor Day to quarterly results, the company has opted to forgo the usual earnings call this quarter.

Operational Successes

The airline achieved a 99.2% completion rate for summer flights despite operational challenges, such as delayed aircraft deliveries due to the ongoing Boeing strike. Alaska Air Group’s fleet grew with the addition of two 737-9 aircraft and one 737-8 aircraft. However, capacity growth for Q4 may be constrained due to anticipated further delivery delays.

Cost Efficiency and Balance Sheet Strength

While unit costs remain impacted by lower-than-planned capacity, Alaska Air Group’s productivity increased by 4.6% year-over-year. The quarter saw enhanced employee retention rates and an uptick in profit-sharing payouts, reflecting a financially sound and employee-focused operational model.

The airline ended the quarter with $3.4 billion in liquidity, supported by undrawn lines of credit. In October, the company secured $2 billion in financing, backed by its Mileage Plan program. The proceeds were used to repay higher-yield debt assumed in the Hawaiian acquisition, resulting in anticipated interest savings of $30 million over the next year.

Capital Expenditures and Future Investments

Alaska Air Group forecasts capital expenditures between $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion for 2024, which includes the planned purchase of 18 new 737 Max aircraft. The company has also invested in initiatives aimed at achieving net-zero emissions by 2040, partnering with JetZero to develop aircraft with a blended-wing body design to reduce fuel usage by up to 50%.

Fourth Quarter 2024 Outlook

For the upcoming quarter, Alaska Air Group forecasts:

Capacity (ASMs) : Increase of 1.5% to 2.5% over Q4 2023

: Increase of 1.5% to 2.5% over Q4 2023 CASMex : Up high single digits year-over-year

: Up high single digits year-over-year RASM : Expected to increase mid-single digits year-over-year

: Expected to increase mid-single digits year-over-year Economic fuel cost : Projected between $2.55 and $2.65 per gallon

: Projected between $2.55 and $2.65 per gallon Adjusted EPS: Anticipated range of $0.20 to $0.40

Mediation to Escape Election Noise

With just days left until Election Day, many Americans are feeling the impact of rising election-related anxiety. Aloft Hotels, known for its trendy, pet-friendly atmosphere, is stepping up to provide a comforting, furry distraction. On November 5, the hotel brand is set to host “No Watch Puppy Parties” at select locations across major U.S. cities, giving guests and locals a lighthearted escape through the calming influence of puppies.

The event aligns with Aloft’s commitment to reducing stress for both people and pets, a hallmark of its ArfSM (Animals R Fun) program. Five Aloft locations—including New York City, Austin, Orlando, Atlanta, and Milwaukee—will transform into puppy-centric oases on election night, offering hotel guests and local residents the opportunity to unwind with playful puppies and dogs from local shelters.

These gatherings offer a respite from the political whirlwind, with no need for reservations or fees, making it accessible for all to indulge in a furry relaxation session.

A New Kind of Election Night Escape

Election night can be a tense experience for many, but Aloft’s “No Watch Puppy Parties” aim to provide a comforting alternative. Attendees can interact with shelter puppies and enjoy endless cuddle time, soothing their stress in the company of warm, friendly pups. To enhance the experience, each gathering will feature a unique, dog-led meditation video to guide attendees into a state of relaxation. This playful meditation includes affirmations like, “Repeat after me: I am PAW-some!”—a lighthearted touch that embodies Aloft’s spirited hospitality.

Adding to the ambiance, each Aloft location’s signature W xyz® bar will offer complimentary cocktails, mocktails, and light bites, giving attendees a chance to kick back, snack, and enjoy the night without any news broadcasts in sight. Each location will keep the atmosphere news-free, ensuring that the night remains all about unwinding, connecting, and soaking in the joy that comes with the presence of pets.

For those unable to join in person, Aloft has extended the experience virtually with a 1-minute dog-led meditation video. This online offering features a sweet-natured pup, inviting viewers to “paws,” stretch, and find calm in an otherwise charged season.

Locations and Event Details

The “No Watch Puppy Parties” will be available at five Aloft Hotels locations nationwide, each bringing its own local flavor to the event:

LOS ANGELES, Oct. 31, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Silent Arrow today announced that one of the company's original GD-2000 flight test aircraft, tail number N23SA, has been donated and accepted by the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum. The 2,000-pound cargo delivery aircraft has arrived at the museum's Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, Virginia for accessioning and future public display.

Silent Arrow GD-2000 flight test unit #12 prior to being lifted by a Bell UH-1H “Huey” to a deployment altitude of 8,720 feet where it was released and performed an autonomous mission at the company’s Pendleton Oregon flight test facility. A total of 73 Silent Arrow GD-2000s have been built to date and the platform has entered full rate production in the UK. (Photo Credit: Jessica Malin) Silent Arrow CEO Chip Yates takes over control of Silent Arrow GD-2000 flight test unit #12 to roll it right side up before returning it to autonomous navigation mode, where it made a smooth and successful landing.

""One of the aerospace industry's emergent challenges is deploying autonomous technologies for the movement of cargo and materials,"" said Aeronautics Department Curator Dr. Roger Connor. ""We are excited to add this important flight test aircraft, that demonstrates a distinct and unique approach to solving unmanned delivery, to our collection.""

The donated aircraft is a full scale, fully functional, 1-ton autonomous cargo delivery glider that was an integral part of the Silent Arrow flight test program and last flew in Pendleton, Oregon on July 16, 2020 after being dropped from a Bell UH-1H ""Huey"" from 5,000 feet AGL (8,720 MSL). The GD-2000 product name means ""Glider, Disposable, 2,000 pounds"" and it is capable of internal or external airborne deployment from rotorcraft or from fixed-wing cargo ramps such as the C-130.

This airframe is significant in that it spent a large portion of its flight inverted, which ultimately required pilot intervention to right the aircraft before returning it to autonomous flight mode after which it made a smooth and successful landing. As a single use, disposable cargo delivery platform, typically the airframes are damaged upon landing in the course of protecting their cargo. However, this autonomous landing resulted in minimal damage and was recovered post flight, repaired and shipped back to Silent Arrow headquarters in Orange County, California.

The serendipitous inverted flight of this test aircraft enabled the Silent Arrow software engineering team to develop an autonomous upset recovery feature which was implemented on all subsequent aircraft and has proven effective during recent C-130 deployments in the U.S. and overseas.

""It's an unbelievable honor to have one of our hard-working flight test aircraft make it into the Smithsonian,"" said Chip Yates, Silent Arrow's Founder and CEO. ""From inauspicious beginnings towing early prototypes with a trailer for data gathering to the present-day C-130, C-17 and A400M deployment programs we have, I am proud of the Silent Arrow team for achieving this milestone.""

About Silent Arrow

The Silent Arrow® product line consists of five attritable, autonomous cargo delivery aircraft capable of carrying 350 to 2,000 pounds of emergency, disaster relief and humanitarian response supplies anywhere in the world on short notice. The Silent Arrow GD-2000, Widebody, SA-PGB, CLS-200 and CLS-300 provide a wide array of contested logistics capabilities to the warfighter. Silent Arrow's engineering team has been awarded more than 22 patents, 6 Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI) aircraft world records and 2 FAI Louis Bleriot medals for disruptive contributions to the aerospace industry. In 2021 Silent Arrow® was selected as a finalist for the Robert J. Collier Trophy as the ""Greatest Achievement in Aeronautics or Astronautics in America,"" and in 2024 a Silent Arrow flight test aircraft, N23SA, was accepted into the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum in Washington, DC.

How is it celebrated in India and the diaspora?",https://pantagraph.com/life-entertainment/nation-world/diwali-explained-india-deepavali-2024-diwaloween/article_05a4c99a-4214-5ea2-83ce-0ba5fe968fde.html,Entertainment,"Diwali is the most important festival of the year in India — and for Hindus in particular.

It is celebrated across faiths by more than a billion people in the world's most populous nation and the diaspora. Over five days, people take part in festive gatherings, fireworks displays, feasts and prayer.

Diwali is derived from the word ""Deepavali,"" which means ""a row of lights."" Celebrants light rows of traditional clay oil lamps outside their homes to symbolize the victory of light over darkness and knowledge over ignorance.

When is Diwali?

The dates of the festival are based on the Hindu lunar calendar, typically falling in late October or early November.

This year, the holiday is being celebrated on Oct. 31 and Nov. 1. In the U.S., Diwali falls on Halloween this year, which has triggered quite a few #Diwaloween memes on social media where some celebrants can be seen lighting diyas in their scary costumes or handing out laddoos to trick-or-treaters.

What are some Hindu stories of Diwali?

While Diwali is a major religious festival for Hindus, it is also observed by Sikhs, Jains and Buddhists. The origin story of Diwali varies depending on the region. All these stories have one underlying theme — the victory of good over evil.

In southern India, Diwali celebrates the victory of Lord Krishna's destruction of the demon Naraka who is said to have imprisoned women and tormented his subjects. In northern India, Diwali honors the triumphant return of Lord Rama, his wife Sita, and brother Lakshmana, from a 14-year exile in the forest.

How is Diwali celebrated?

The festival brings with it a number of unique traditions, which also vary by the region. What all celebrations have in common are the lights, fireworks, feasting, new clothes and praying.

—In southern India, many have an early morning warm oil bath to symbolize bathing in the holy River Ganges as a form of physical and spiritual purification.

—In the north, worshipping the Goddess Lakshmi, who symbolizes wealth and prosperity, is the norm.

Gambling is a popular tradition because of the belief whoever gambled on Diwali night would prosper throughout the year. Many people buy gold on the first day of Diwali, known as Dhanteras — an act they believe will bring them good luck.

Setting off firecrackers is a cherished tradition, as is exchanging sweets and gifts among friends and family. Diwali celebrations typically feature rangoli, which are geometric, floral patterns drawn on the floor using colorful powders. This year, several northern Indian states, including the capital New Delhi, are instituting partial or total fireworks bans to combat rising pollution levels during Diwali.

What are the Diwali stories from other faiths?

Buddhists, Jains and Sikhs have their own Diwali stories:

—Jains observe Diwali as the day the Lord Mahavira, the last of the great teachers, attained nirvana, which is liberation from the cycle of birth, death and rebirth.

—Sikhs celebrate Bandi Chhor Divas — a day that overlaps with Diwali — to commemorate the release of Guru Hargobind, a revered figure in the faith, who had been imprisoned for 12 years by the Mughal emperor Jahangir.

—Buddhists observe the day as one when the Hindu Emperor Ashoka, who ruled in the third century B.C., converted to Buddhism.

New in 2024: Diwali Barbie

This year, Mattel has released its ""Barbie Signature Diwali Doll"" by designer Anita Dongre who wrote on Instagram that her Barbie represents ""the fashion-forward modern women who wears India on her sleeve with pride.""

In contrast to her earliest iteration in 1996 who was clad in a bright pink sari or the 2012 avatar who was packaged with a ""monkey friend,"" Diwali Barbie is fashionably dressed in a lehnga, an ankle length embroidered skirt with motifs from Dongre's home state of Rajasthan, a cropped blouse and vest.

This doll, priced at $40, sold out on day one on Mattel's website.

We are excited to host our Investor Day on December 10th, where we will share more detail about our vision as a combined company, including higher synergy estimates driven by the combination, discuss our strategy to expand margins and generate free cash flow, and provide 2025 guidance. Given the proximity of third quarter earnings to our Investor Day, we announced on October 21st that we would not hold an earnings conference call this quarter. While we expect to resume regular quarterly earnings calls again in January 2025, this quarter we are providing additional narrative on our third quarter performance, including discussion of Air Group trends excluding Hawaiian Airlines within our earnings release today.

Air Group's consolidated results reported in the third quarter of 2024 include 13 days of Hawaiian Airlines results, while prior comparable periods exclude any Hawaiian results. Except where noted below, the following discussion of Air Group's third quarter performance reflect legacy-Alaska performance, excluding Hawaiian for the 13 days it was part of the combined company.

Income and EPS:

Today we reported GAAP net income of $236 million, or $1.84 earnings per share for the third quarter of 2024. Excluding special items and mark-to-market fuel hedge accounting adjustments, we reported net income of $289 million, or $2.25 earnings per share, significantly exceeding our original guidance for the quarter of $1.40 to $1.60 and coming in at the high end of our revised guidance published on September 12th. Our adjusted pretax margin of 13.0% led industry peers for the 2nd consecutive quarter and continues to demonstrate the strength of our business model. We have built a solid foundation of robust earnings and operating cash flow generation that we're excited to continue building on through the combination of both Alaska and Hawaiian Airlines, as we realize substantial synergies amidst a strong demand environment and constructive industry backdrop.

Revenue:

During the quarter, Alaska saw unit revenues inflect positive in August, with strength in booking trends continuing into the fourth quarter. We've seen improvement across the Alaska network, in particular in the Pacific Northwest and Latin America regions. Corporate demand showed renewed strength in September and into October, which drove meaningful yield improvements on close-in bookings. Managed corporate revenue grew 9% year-over-year in the third quarter with double digit growth from the technology and professional services industries. Premium revenue performance also remained strong this quarter, continuing to outperform main cabin, with first and premium class revenue up 10% and 8% year-over-year respectively on 5% year-over-year growth in premium seat capacity. Unit revenues are expected to continue their positive trajectory, from up low-single digits in the third quarter to up mid-single digits in the fourth quarter.

""The opportunities for this newly combined global airline are clear, and we are poised to be the airline that connects the West Coast to the world with an experience rooted in care and performance,"" said CCO Andrew Harrison. ""We are investing in our commercial engine to compete more effectively with the larger carriers, increase loyalty among our guests and realize synergies from both our commercial and cargo businesses. These investments include re-imagined lounge and onboard offerings designed to meet the needs of our most loyal guests, optimized route networks that get people to more places in less time, a seamless booking to boarding experience, and more.""

Operationally, Alaska delivered a reliable performance for our guests during their peak summer travel plans, not only flying our largest ever summer schedule, but doing so with a 99.2% completion rate. Growth this year has been impacted by delayed aircraft deliveries, which we expect to continue due to the ongoing strike at Boeing. Further aircraft delivery delays are expected to limit capacity growth in the final quarter of 2024 relative to our prior resource planning expectations earlier in the year.

Costs:

Costs performed as expected and were in line with our prior guidance, although unit costs remain pressured from lower capacity due to delivery delays. We remain resourced for higher capacity and are experiencing the lowest attrition rates across the company since 2019. One-third of our second half 2024 unit cost increases on a year-over-year basis are directly related to relative overstaffing given originally higher planned flying volumes, as well as the natural pressure that lower capacity puts on our fixed cost base which is about half of total costs. We expect this pressure to be transitory and to return to optimized resource levels relative to our capacity throughout 2025. Despite this, productivity for the quarter improved 4.6% year-over-year.

Our expected profit sharing payouts increased materially in the quarter, primarily driven by lower fuel prices and improving revenue trends, offset by a reduction in expected wage expense from our tentative agreement with our flight attendants which did not ratify during the quarter.

Balance Sheet and Capex:

Turning to our balance sheet, we ended the quarter with total liquidity of $3.4 billion, inclusive of approximately $850 million in undrawn lines of credit which were upsized following the closing of the Hawaiian acquisition. Subsequent to quarter end, we raised $2.0 billion in Term Loan B and Bond debt collateralized by Alaska's Mileage Plan program. The bond offering garnered investor interest of greater than 7x our issued amount, and we achieved the tightest spreads seen on similar debt within the industry outside of the pandemic, a testament to the strength of our loyalty collateral and our balance sheet. Approximately $1.4 billion was used to repay higher-yielding debt assumed in the merger, which we expect to result in annual interest cost savings of approximately $30 million over the next twelve months. Following the loyalty financing and debt repayments in October, our debt to capitalization and net leverage sit today at 58% and 2.4x respectively, still among the strongest balance sheets in the industry.

For capital expenditures, we continue to plan to incur approximately $1.2 to $1.3 billion in 2024. This amount assumes we pay for 18 737 Max aircraft this year, subject to Boeing delivery ability.

Hawaiian Airlines Trends:

Although we only recently completed the acquisition of Hawaiian Airlines, we are encouraged by the continued improvement in the Hawaiian network. Following significant losses incurred in the fourth quarter of 2023, Hawaiian's EBITDAR turned positive in the second quarter and pretax results are expected to approach break even in the fourth quarter. The improvement is expected to be driven by both revenues and costs. North America PRASM inflected positive during the third quarter and we expect will be up mid-single digits year-over-year in the fourth quarter, while International PRASM is gradually improving from down double digits toward flat year-over-year in the fourth quarter of 2024. Neighbor Island results are also showing material year-over-year improvements. Several temporary cost headwinds that have challenged Hawaiian's performance have mostly passed, with the impact of the A321 GTF engine-driven groundings fully resolved and the majority of the A330 Amazon freighter and 787 new fleet startup related costs completed.

Integration:

With a proven playbook from our integration of Virgin America, we are prepared and excited to begin in earnest to bring the operating platforms of Alaska and Hawaiian together, while we maintain the legacy and value of both brands, each of which have been built over 90 years respectively. We plan to achieve three significant integration milestones in the next 18 months – the launch of a single loyalty platform, receipt of a single operating certificate, and integration of our passenger service system. We will also soon begin working with our labor-represented workgroups to start the joint collective bargain process.

We are on track to finish the year strong and expect to be among the top 3 pretax margin producers in the industry for the full year, inclusive of Hawaiian's results from the date of acquisition closing. There is much to be excited about for our airlines as we move ahead and begin unlocking the multiples of potential we can accomplish as a combined company.

Fourth Quarter 2024 Guidance:

For the fourth quarter, we expect the following results, inclusive of Hawaiian. Expectations for the fourth quarter are compared to pro forma historical results, as if the acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2023. Pro forma historical results were included with this Form 8-K. Full year 2024 EPS is expected finish above the midpoint of our previous guidance of $3.50 to $4.50 per share, inclusive of Hawaiian's results.

SPECIAL ITEMS (unaudited)

Air Group has classified certain operating and non-operating expenses as special items due to their unusual or infrequently occurring nature. We believe disclosing information about these items separately improves comparable year-over-year analysis and allows stakeholders to better understand our results of operations. A description of the special items is provided below.

Fleet transition: Fleet transition costs (benefits) are associated with the retirement and disposition of Airbus acquired from Virgin America and Q400 aircraft.

Labor agreements: Labor agreement costs in 2024 are for retroactive pay for Alaska flight attendants pursuant to the tentative agreement reached in the second quarter of 2024; the agreement did not pass and negotiations are ongoing. Costs in 2023 are for contractual changes to Alaska pilots' sick leave benefits.

Integration costs: Integration costs are associated with the acquisition of Hawaiian Airlines and primarily consist of legal and professional fees, change in control payments, and other employee-related expenses.

Litigation: Litigation costs represent expenses associated with the Virgin trademark license agreement with the Virgin Group and recorded following a negative ruling in an appeal case in the second quarter of 2024.

Net non-operating: These costs are primarily for interest expense recognized in 2023 associated with certain Virgin America A321neo lease agreements which were modified as part of Alaska's fleet transition.

(a) Operating income can be reconciled using the trailing twelve month operating income as filed quarterly with the SEC.

Note A: Pursuant to Regulation G, we are providing reconciliations of reported non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable financial measures reported on a GAAP basis. We believe that consideration of these non-GAAP financial measures may be important to investors for the following reasons:

By excluding certain costs from our unit metrics, we believe that we have better visibility into the results of operations. Our industry is highly competitive and is characterized by high fixed costs, so even a small reduction in non-fuel operating costs can result in a significant improvement in operating results. We believe that all domestic carriers are similarly impacted by changes in jet fuel costs over the long run, so it is important for management and investors to understand the impact of company-specific cost drivers which are more controllable by management. We adjust for expenses related directly to our freighter aircraft operations to allow for better comparability to other domestic carriers that do not operate freighter aircraft. We also exclude certain special charges as they are unusual or nonrecurring in nature and adjusting for these expenses allows management and investors to better understand our cost performance.

CASMex is one of the most important measures used by management and by the Air Group Board of Directors in assessing quarterly and annual cost performance. CASMex is also a measure commonly used by industry analysts, and we believe it is the basis by which they have historically compared our airline to others in the industry. The measure is also the subject of frequent questions from investors.

Adjusted pretax income is an important metric for the employee incentive plan, which covers the majority of Air Group employees.

Disclosure of the individual impact of certain noted items provides investors the ability to measure and monitor performance both with and without these special items. We believe that disclosing the impact of these items as noted above is important because it provides information on significant items that are not necessarily indicative of future performance. Industry analysts and investors consistently measure our performance without these items for better comparability between periods and among other airlines.

Although we disclose our unit revenue, we do not, nor are we able to, evaluate unit revenue excluding the impact that changes in fuel costs have had on ticket prices. Fuel expense represents a large percentage of our total operating expenses. Fluctuations in fuel prices often drive changes in unit revenue in the mid-to-long term. Although we believe it is useful to evaluate non-fuel unit costs for the reasons noted above, we would caution readers of these financial statements not to place undue reliance on unit costs excluding fuel as a measure or predictor of future profitability because of the significant impact of fuel costs on our business.

This honor, reserved for pilots with over 50 years of exemplary aviation experience, recognizes Don's commitment to safety, mentorship, and excellence in the field of aviation.

Don Johnson - Recipient of Wright Brothers Master Pilot Award

Don's passion for aviation began at the early age of 14 when he soloed in gliders, marking the start of a career that has now spanned more than five decades. By 15, he had purchased his first plane, a Cessna 172. At 17, he earned his private pilot license and instrument rating, followed by his commercial pilot license at 18. By 19, Don had already become the owner of the largest glider school in the U.S., Holiday Haven Glider School in Tehachapi, CA.

His illustrious career continued to soar as Don reached international captain status by the age of 30. He later served as Director of Operations and Chief Pilot for Harpo, Inc., overseeing Oprah Winfrey's flight department for over 12 years. In addition to holding 14 type ratings and an A&P license, Don has twice served on the Gulfstream Customer Advisory Board, contributing to the development of the G550 and G650 aircraft.

With over 30,000 hours of flight time, Don has flown to every continent, made hundreds of trips to Europe, and visited countries like Jordan, Libya, China, Japan, India, Australia, and South Africa on dozens of occasions. His career spans decades, marked by an impeccable safety record, a testament to his commitment to aviation excellence.

Don's philosophy, shaped by years of experience, is to ""Prepare for the unexpected, but fly as if everything will go smoothly,"" advice he often shares with the next generation of pilots. His dedication to safety and mentorship has shaped countless aviators, and his leadership fosters a culture of excellence and integrity in aviation.

Reflecting on his career, Don says, ""I've been fortunate to live my passion for aviation every day. It's more than a job; it's a way of life."" This lifetime of achievement, leadership, and devotion to the skies has earned him the esteemed FAA award, solidifying his enduring legacy.

Prime Jet congratulates Don Johnson on this well-deserved recognition. His remarkable journey continues to inspire both his colleagues and the future of aviation.

1028,2024-10-28 01:51:01,"San Francisco's Great Highway transformed into Halloween party, highlighting Measure K debate",https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/san-franciscos-great-highway-halloween-party-measure-k-debate/,Politics,"On Sunday afternoon, San Francisco's Great Highway was transformed into a massive Halloween party for kids.

It highlighted the ongoing debate about whether the road, which is closed to traffic on weekends, should be permanently closed to cars to create a new public open space. But neighbors in the area nearby say they'll be the ones paying the price for it.

There was no shortage of visitors to the Great Highway or as it was called on Sunday, the ""Great Hauntway.""

Thousands of kids and their parents showed up to strut their costumed stuff and snag some candy in the process. But along with the treats, there was also a generous supply of political messaging in favor of Measure K, a city-wide ballot initiative that would close the Great Highway to cars permanently.

""Obviously, today is extraordinary. There's so many thousands of kids out here,"" said Measure K volunteer Peter Belden, dressed in a Superman suit. ""But by making it a park, we increase access and make it accessible to more people and by making this a park, it enables us to restore the habitat and also reduce some of the runoff pollution that comes from vehicles.""

""This was actually land owned by San Francisco Parks and Rec. And this was put in as a highway in the 1930's,"" Measure K supporter George Davis pointed out. ""Just when they closed it off part-time, this has become the third most visited park in the city.""

""I think it's spectacular,"" said Meredith Benton, as she steered her kids through the crowd. ""We come on Sundays. It's empty, the kids can ride bikes, we run around and it gives us a lot more open space in a kind of crowded-feeling city.""

But there is also a crowded feeling in the neighborhoods next to the closed highway. On Sunday, Suzanne Sandidge was barely able to get her car to her house.

""I had to wait through seven cars coming until finally I just made my way. I mean it was kind of scary,"" she said, wondering what will happen if the measure passes. ""It's just going to be madness. I don't like it. Too much traffic.""

The argument of those opposing the closure is that public events like the Halloween gathering are rare. They said on most weekdays the area around the Great Highway is deserted, but with the road permanently closed, all the cars that normally travel during the commute will funnel into their neighborhoods.

""The argument is, if you close the road the cars are going somewhere else or they're going to go away. Well, the cars aren't going away,"" said neighbor Fred McFadden.

The southern end of the Great Highway is scheduled to be closed in early 2026 because of natural coastal erosion. If the entire highway is permanently closed, the city's plan is to try to shift cars east to Sunset Boulevard, but neighbors say they will inevitably cut through the residential streets.

""They closed it permanently during Covid and that was really bad because it was 24/7. And now every weekend, I'm impacted,"" said McFadden. ""The traffic goes up, everybody's pushed down to the Lower Great and to the other avenues.""

""There's a faction of folks that don't like cars,"" said Measure K opponent Steve Gorski. ""And so, anytime they can get a chance to take away a street from cars, they do it.""

And they think it's unfair that the vast majority of people voting on Measure K will stand to benefit while only the neighbors will suffer the consequences.

""Because it's city-wide, the majority of city dwellers who are not familiar with this area, and don't live here, are going to vote 'yes' and close that road permanently, 24/7, and we're going to be afflicted, impacted, with the four-lane road closed,"" said McFadden.

Opponents point out that Measure K doesn't create a new park, there's no money to do that. It would only shut down the roadway.

But supporters say that's the first step in creating something new. With Measure K, everyone will have a say in what happens, whether they have skin in the game or not."

NEW YORK — Shohei Ohtani did not look particularly comfortable in Game 3 of the World Series following his shoulder injury in Game 2.

It did not particularly matter for the Dodgers.

Instead, it was a stellar start from Walker Buehler and two timely hits from Ohtani’s fellow MVPs, Mookie Betts and Freddie Freeman, that proved to be the difference in Los Angeles’ 4-2 victory over the Yankees on Monday in the Bronx in Game 3 of this World Series. With that, the Dodgers claimed a commanding 3-0 series lead.

While it was hardly the most explosive display by the Dodgers’ offense — just four runs on five hits — Game 3 still exemplified just how exhausting it is for a starting pitcher to try to navigate the L.A. lineup. Yankees starter Clarke Schmidt walked Ohtani on four pitches to start the game — an instant reminder that even with a hampered shoulder and limited success in the series thus far, Ohtani presents a threat any time he steps in the box.

The first of two lengthy battles between Schmidt and Betts followed, with Betts flying out to left field on the seventh offering from Schmidt. Up came Freeman, ready to further strengthen his case for World Series MVP.

“Thankfully, he threw all three pitches in the first three pitches,” said Freeman, who had never faced Schmidt in his career before Monday. “He went sweeper on the first pitch and then went cutter up, and then he threw the knuckle curve. So I saw all three pitches. I was OK with being down two strikes because I got to see everything he had.”

On the fourth pitch, Schmidt went back to the cutter up and in — a very similar spot from which Freeman had taken a 97 mph fastball from Carlos Rodón way out to right field for a home run in Game 2.

“I don't think he was trying to throw that cutter in that spot,” Freeman said afterward.

But that’s where that cutter went, and once again, Freeman connected in a big way. The ball exploded off his bat, enjoying the brief journey to the short porch in right field at Yankee Stadium before crashing down into the crowd. Seven minutes into Game 3, the Dodgers had a 2-0 lead, and any positive buzz that had been building in the Bronx vanished.

In the top of the third, it was Betts’ turn to add to the lead, albeit with a much different genre of offensive excellence. After drawing a leadoff walk, Tommy Edman advanced to second on an Ohtani groundout, bringing up Betts to face Schmidt with a runner in scoring position. Monday’s game was also Betts’ first time facing Schmidt in his career. Though Schmidt had gotten Betts to fly out in his first at-bat, he failed to coax a single whiff from the stingy Betts, whose exceptional contact skills remain the core feature of his elite offensive profile.

That trend continued in their prolonged second encounter. Schmidt quickly fell behind 2-0 with a high cutter and a sinker that ran low and inside for ball two. But the right-hander returned to attack mode, hurling the entirety of his arsenal into different portions of the zone in search of a much-needed out as his pitch count climbed. On the ninth pitch, Schmidt went with his high-spin knuckle-curve, but rather than breaking sharply down below the zone, it backed up into the inner-half, where Betts could handle it.

It was hardly the crisp contact Freeman achieved against Schmidt, but Betts connected nevertheless, lofting the ball high over first baseman Anthony Rizzo’s head before it plopped into the grass just inside the right-field line in front of Juan Soto, allowing Edman to race around and score the Dodgers’ third run.

Schmidt had tried everything and even yielded weak contact from Betts — his RBI single had a measly 71.2 mph exit velocity — but it wasn’t good enough. Of the 68 pitches Schmidt threw in his abbreviated outing in Game 3, 16 of them, or 23.5% — three sweepers, four sinkers, four knuckle-curves and five cutters — were deployed across his two showdowns with Betts.

“That was one of the at-bats that set the tone,” Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said afterward. “Tommy did a great job reading the ball off the bat, going on contact, scoring right there. But that at-bat to just kind of win pitches, get down with two strikes and to keep fighting to still drive in a run — we did that all night.

“I thought we took really good at-bats. Mookie kind of sets the tone with that.”

In the bottom of the fourth, it was Betts’ glovework that prompted another sigh of disappointment from a Yankee Stadium crowd seeking any reason to get excited. With Giancarlo Stanton on second base, Jazz Chisholm Jr. smoked a line drive toward Betts in right field. Betts’ initial jump suggested he expected the hard-hit ball to carry more toward the right-center-field gap, but the ball had immense amounts of topspin, sending it careening to the ground with unusual velocity.

This forced Betts to make a last-second decision to either stay upward and play the ball on a hop, yielding the hit, or make a desperate, diving attempt to snare the ball — with the risk of it bouncing past him and no one backing him up.

With six Gold Gloves and an exceptional combination of athleticism, coordination and confidence, Betts opted for the latter, diving forward and snatching the ball just above the grass for a nifty second out.

With two championships and a wealth of accolades already amassed over his 11-year career, Betts has little left to prove; his status as one of his generation’s greatest players and a likely future Hall of Famer is solidly secure. But for a player who understands the sky-high expectations for both himself and his high-profile team, Betts’ standout postseason is a refreshing bit of redemption following his two most recent trips to October, which were hardly a reflection of his talent.

Betts went 2-for-14 in the Dodgers’ NLDS loss to San Diego in 2022 and 0-for-11 against Arizona in Los Angeles’ shocking NLDS exit in 2023. Holding such a small sample against the superstar is surely unfair, but as one of the faces of this franchise, his lack of impact the past two Octobers lingered into the winter after Dodgers campaigns that ended in disappointing fashion.

This current run, which has L.A. within one win of a World Series, is much more reminiscent of Betts’ first October in Dodger blue back in 2020, when the team stormed through the expanded postseason field and won the franchise’s first championship since 1988. While Corey Seager’s epic showing earned him MVP honors in both the NLCS and World Series, Betts was a steady and productive presence as L.A.’s leadoff man, hitting .296/.378/.493 in 18 games with two home runs, both in the World Series against Tampa Bay.

This October, Betts is hitting .291/.394/.582 with more walks than strikeouts while consistently showcasing top-tier glovework in right field. He has hit four home runs in 13 games, the same amount he had in 58 career postseason games before 2024. Thanks to Tommy Edman’s breakout NLCS and Freeman’s World Series power surge, Betts is unlikely to collect any individual postseason hardware. But his constant contributions on both sides of the ball are a huge reason the Dodgers are one win away from the only accolade anyone in their clubhouse cares about.

""He's Mookie Betts,” Freeman said after Game 3. “I think everyone was a little worried [after] those first couple games in San Diego in the LDS” — when Betts went 0-for-6, another tiny sample of failure, indicative of the standard to which he’s held — “but we all know, it's Mookie Betts. He's one of the best players of all time.""

Betts has understood the assignment for the 2024 Dodgers from the very beginning. At the team’s FanFest in early February, following a historic offseason packed with big-name acquisitions, Betts did not shy away from what would be expected of a team with a roster featuring such an overwhelming amount of star-level talent.

""It's World Series or nothing,"" he said then. ""You know it's gonna be tough. Every game is gonna be the other team's World Series. It is what it is, but we signed up for it. We have to embrace that.""

Of course, there were some twists and turns and turbulent times along the way. But the 2024 Dodgers amassed baseball’s best record in the regular season and are now on the verge of sweeping the team with the best record in the American League to accomplish that sky-high goal set for themselves all those months ago.

For Betts, it was World Series or nothing — and if his recent play is any indication, nothing was never really an option. For Freeman — who has all but locked up World Series MVP, should the Dodgers indeed secure the fourth and final victory in the coming days — adding to his personal award collection means little in comparison to the collective goal that remains in front of his team.

“I really just want to hoist that trophy,” he said. “I don't care how that happens. I don't care if I go 0-for-the-next-70 with 70 strikeouts. As long as we win, that's all I care about.”"

Announced eight months ago, the tribute honors Wade’s 16 seasons with the team, solidifying his legendary status. Drafted fifth overall in 2003, Wade led the Heat to three championships and earned 13 All-Star titles, becoming the team’s all-time leading scorer.

The statue captures Wade’s 2009 game-winning shot against the Chicago Bulls. After making the shot, he jumped onto the scorer’s table, declaring, “This is my house!”. Surrounded by family, longtime teammate Udonis Haslem, and Heat president Pat Riley, Wade reflected on his legacy, describing it as an ongoing journey toward a meaningful goal. He expressed deep gratitude to the Heat organization, his teammates, and fans for making this moment possible.

Dwyane Wade’s Reaction to His Statue Fallout on the Social Media

However, the unveiling sparked a range of reactions on social media, from admiration to amusement over the statue’s resemblance to Wade. Some fans questioned the accuracy of the statue’s likeness, drawing comparisons that Wade found humorous.

“Yeah, I have an iPhone… Social media world is about opinions… Send some memes. We don’t care. It was a special moment yesterday,”

Wade took the comments in stride from the social media during the Heat vs. Pistons pregame conference on Monday. The Heat legend emphasized that the purpose of the statue wasn’t to capture his exact likeness. Instead, he believes the statue symbolize a defining moment in his career and the franchise’s history.

LOS ANGELES -- McDonald's will resume selling Quarter Pounders in all restaurants in the coming week after considering new data regarding an E. coli outbreak linked to its famed burgers, the company announced Sunday.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a food safety alert Tuesday warning dozens of people reported eating the Quarter Pounder sandwich at McDonald's before becoming sick.

The E. coli outbreak has led to 75 illness across 13 states, including 22 hospitalizations and one death, according to the latest information from the CDC, with most of the related illnesses occurring in Colorado.

A specific ingredient has not been confirmed as the source of the outbreak, federal agencies said Friday, but the US Food and Drug Administration previously said the slivered onions or beef patties on Quarter Pounder sandwiches are the likely source of contamination.

On Sunday, the Colorado Department of Agriculture said McDonald's beef patties used for the Quarter Pounder tested negative for E. coli. The department tested fresh patties from restaurants associated with the outbreak.

Based on the findings from the Colorado agriculture department and after comparing CDC data with its own supply chain data, McDonald's is confident in ruling out fresh beef patties as a source of contamination, according to a Sunday news release.

At the prestigious 57th Annual ANSAP Convention, sponsored by MedPro International, Senior Manager of International Testing Joely Carrillo addressed an audience of 1,100 healthcare leaders on efforts to educate nurses and develop healthcare in local communities while also speaking on the importance of prioritizing physical, mental, and emotional well-being. During the two-week visit, Carrillo also hosted five nursing seminars focused on Global Giving’s educational initiatives, engaging primarily with fourth-year nursing students. “It was an incredible experience,” Carrillo stated. Her lectures provided practical strategies for managing test anxiety, emphasizing that the right tools can significantly enhance performance. In addition to in-person instruction, students benefited from recorded lectures from MedProU’s web-based series.

Carrillo also gained valuable insights into the challenges faced by nursing students, particularly regarding limited internet access, which affects their educational resources. “Internet access is crucial,” she explained. “This visit has highlighted the need for alternative approaches to education that can adapt to these challenges.” Carrillo also toured Perpetual Help Medical Center in Las Piñas, a partner in MedPro’s Global Giving events.

As a result, the Quarter Pounder will begin to return to certain locations.

The Colorado Department of Agriculture announced McDonald's brand ""fresh and frozen beef patties"" tested negative for E. coli after its lab analyzed dozens of subsamples.

CDA says it has completed all beef testing and does not anticipate receiving further samples.

Meanwhile, the federal investigation into the deadly E. coli outbreak in Colorado has focused on ground beef patties and onions. There continues to be no evidence that onions grown in Colorado are linked to the outbreak.

According to McDonald's, The 900 restaurants that historically received slivered onions from Taylor Farms' Colorado Springs facility will resume sales of Quarter Pounders without slivered onions. Those restaurants are in Colorado, Kansas, and Wyoming, as well as portions of Idaho, Iowa, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Utah. The restaurant chain also noted it has stopped getting onions from that facility indefinitely.

""The issue appears to be contained to a particular ingredient and geography, and we remain very confident that any contaminated product related to this outbreak has been removed from our supply chain and is out of all McDonald's restaurants,"" McDonald's North American Chief Supply Chain Officer Cesar Piña said in a statement Sunday

Since the outbreak was first announced, CBS News Colorado confirmed one older man on the Western Slope died after consuming a Quarter Pounder from a McDonald's location in the state. Initial information also confirmed more than two dozen people had become ill due to E. coli-affected Quarter Pounders.

Nationwide, this outbreak has sickened 75 people in more than a dozen states, but Colorado remains the only state impacted that has experienced a death due to it.

The Colorado Department of Public Health says there have been 26 cases reported in nine different Colorado counties, and they are located in several different parts of the state:

Arapahoe County

Chaffee County

El Paso County

Gunnison County

Larimer County

Mesa County

Routt County

Teller County

Weld County

The illnesses were reported between the last days of September and through Oct. 11. An investigation by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention into the outbreak is ongoing.

McDonald's company leaders previously said they've taken Quarter Pounders off the menu in states where there have been outbreaks."

1029,2024-10-29 08:30:32,"Poor sleep in middle age could affect the brain in a surprising way, study finds",https://www.foxnews.com/health/poor-sleep-middle-age-could-affect-brain-surprising-way-study-finds,Health,"There are some obvious signs of a poor night’s sleep — fatigue, irritability and trouble focusing, to name a few — but it can also have some hidden effects.

In a new study led by University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), poor sleep was linked to faster brain aging in middle-aged adults.

While previous studies have focused on older adults, the average age of the 589 people in this study was 40 years old, according to a press release.

'SLEEP DIVORCE' ON VACATION: TRAVEL TREND HAS COUPLES 'BREAKING UP' AT BEDTIME

The participants completed two sleep questionnaires five years apart. After 15 years, they underwent brain scans.

""We calculated brain age using a machine learning approach, using MRI data to estimate the amount of brain shrinkage corresponding to a specific age,"" study author Clémence Cavaillès, PhD, a researcher at UCSF, told Fox News Digital.

""We showed that poor sleep that persisted over five years — and specifically when it related to insomnia symptoms — was found to be highly relevant to brain aging.""

‘WHY DO I HAVE RESTLESS LEGS AT NIGHT?’: ASK A DOCTOR

When evaluating sleep quality, the researchers looked at six poor sleep characteristics: short sleep duration, bad sleep quality, difficulty falling asleep, difficulty staying asleep, early morning awakening and daytime sleepiness.

Middle-aged participants with two to three poor sleep characteristics had a brain age that was 1.6 years older than those with no more than one poor sleep characteristic, according to Cavaillès.

Those with more than three poor sleep characteristics exhibited a brain age of 2.6 years older.

""Poor sleep that persisted over five years — and specifically when it related to insomnia symptoms — was found to be highly relevant to brain aging.""

The findings were published in Neurology, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology.

""These findings are critical because they demonstrate that the link between sleep disturbances and brain health extends beyond older adulthood, suggesting that poor sleep in early midlife may already contribute to accelerated brain aging,"" he said.

Advanced brain aging is associated with cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease-related patterns, the researcher noted.

""Therefore, poor sleep may be an important target for early interventions aimed at preventing neurocognitive decline, even before the lesion’s accumulation begins.""

'FOR BETTER SLEEP, HOW CAN I REDUCE NIGHTTIME BATHROOM TRIPS?': ASK A DOCTOR

The researchers were surprised to find that there was not an association between sleep duration and accelerated brain aging, Cavaillès noted.

""Sleep duration in midlife may be influenced by numerous factors, such as work, stress, multitasking or menopause,"" he told Fox News Digital.

""Thus, it is also possible that its association with cognition is more complex during this critical period, and potentially more difficult to capture and/or less impactful.""

Overall, the study results suggest that the importance of sleep for brain health in midlife would be more closely tied to quality rather than quantity in midlife, the researcher added.

‘Integral relationship’

Dr. Jocelyn Y. Cheng, a New Jersey neurologist and spokesperson for the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, was not involved in the study but weighed in on the findings.

""This study provides further support for the integral relationship between sleep and brain health,"" she told Fox News Digital.

'HOW MUCH SLEEP IS TOO MUCH?': ASK A DOCTOR

""The findings highlight particular aspects of poor sleep — specifically early morning awakening and persistent difficulty with initiating sleep, which were associated with greater estimated age-related brain atrophy as measured by MRI.""

Sleep plays a role in clearing out beta-amyloid, the protein that accumulates in the brains of people who develop Alzheimer’s disease, Cheng noted.

When someone gets poor sleep, that clearance ability is reduced.

""Being readily identifiable, the onset of these symptoms may represent a key timepoint during which intervention could mitigate the development of disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease later in life,"" Cheng added.

Potential limitations

The study did have some limitations, including the fact that it relied on people reporting their own sleep habits, which may not always be accurate, according to Cavaillès.

""Also, because this was an observational study, we can’t say for certain that poor sleep directly causes brain aging — only that there’s a strong connection between the two,"" he added.

""This study provides further support for the integral relationship between sleep and brain health.""

Cheng agreed that causation cannot be determined from the study, and also noted that it did not investigate whether brain atrophy had an impact on cognition.

Despite these limitations, she said, ""There are plausible roles that poor sleep may play in brain health.""

Improving sleep quality

Based on the findings, people can improve their quality of rest by adopting several good sleep hygiene practices, Cavaillès said.

""They can start by maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, going to bed and waking up at the same time every day,"" he said.

""Creating an ideal sleep environment — keeping the bedroom dark, quiet and at a cool temperature — also helps.""

Regular exercise and exposure to natural sunlight can also improve sleep quality.

Cavaillès also suggests avoiding screens and blue light, as well as stimulants like caffeine and alcohol.

""Incorporating relaxation techniques before bed, such as deep breathing or meditation, can also help prepare the body for sleep,"" the researcher added.

Cheng echoed that healthy sleep is essential for a healthy brain, hence the importance of maintaining good sleep habits.

""If someone is facing persistent problems with sleep quality or insomnia symptoms, they should undergo further evaluation,"" she said.

The therapies involving the usage of stem cells are utilized for a number of years within the therapy of malignant illnesses of the blood and bone marrow. In recent times, specifically, it has begun to check potential therapies with stem cells within the subject of regenerative drugs.

What are stem cells and why a lot buzz regarding their medical perspective? These stem cells carry nice hope for the medical researchers for locating treatments towards lethal illnesses. For instance, when they’re injected in sufferers, the stem cells are capable of regenerate and replenish the bone marrow and the immune system probably broken by chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy.

The stem cells within the umbilical wire blood, nevertheless, will be multiplied extra simply than regular bone marrow cells and a few sorts of cells contained in umbilical wire blood can be utilized as much as 40 instances. For instance of this potential, from 10 cells will be created as much as 10 trillion cells.

Tolerability

With the intention to reduce rejection reactions, needs to be used the stem cells of the affected person, since they, not like the cells from international donor, are tolerated by the physique with out issues. The cells don’t personal, in truth, aren’t acknowledged by the immune system and are attacked. In these circumstances it turns into needed taking medicine for the Suppression of the immune system for the whole length of life with consequent inconvenience and important negative effects.

An instance of efficient use

The applying most generally used that entails the usage of stem cells is the remedy following a coronary heart assault. The guts muscle after a coronary heart assault, is broken and kind scar tissue that forestalls correct cardiac contraction and thus compromises the perform of the center itself.

Because of medical advances most sufferers now survive the assault. Lots of them, nevertheless, proceed to undergo from persistent coronary heart failure.This situation will be improved, and even prevented, if we may, by a “renewal” of the stem cells of the center, to restore the center muscle.

Future functions

At present, in regenerative drugs, they’re used cells, particularly bone marrow, purified in a somewhat selective. They’re, due to this fact, a necessity for brand new procedures which permit to pick and direct the stem cells within the formation of several types of tissue, whereas sustaining excessive replication capability. These, nevertheless, should not present any indicators of growing older and no chromosomal genetic harm that may entail the chance of creating malignancies. Umbilical Wire blood stem cells fulfill these circumstances in a really perfect method.

There are already a number of medical research on the usage of therapies based mostly on stem cells from umbilical wire blood is in section II and section III, particularly within the US, on the next circumstances:

• Mind harm (childhood trauma)

• Autoimmune illnesses (kind 1 diabetes, lupus)

• Spinal wire harm

• Cardiac and vascular

On this trial demonstrates the prevalence of stem cells from umbilical wire blood in comparison with different regeneration in coronary heart illness and within the therapy of mind harm.

One of many key challenges is the proliferation of stem cells within the wire blood. In Israeli, a laboratory was developed for the multiplication of cells of the wire blood that may multiply the variety of cells as much as 200 instances.

These research are aimed on the therapy of malignant illnesses of the blood and bone marrow, successful of those trials reinforce a lot data and spotlight the significance of stem cells of umbilical wire blood for different therapies."

Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores improved in two of three subjects





Data presented at the Clinical Trials on Alzheimer’s Disease (CTAD) conference in Madrid, 3 to 5 p.m. CET, October 29 and 30, 2024





NEWPORT BEACH, Calif., Oct. 29, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Regeneration Biomedical, Inc. (“RBI”), a clinical-stage company developing autologous stem cell treatments for neurodegenerative diseases, today announced a presentation on the first dose cohort from a Phase 1 clinical trial of Wnt-activated, autologous, expanded, adipose-derived stem cells (RB-ADSCs) administered directly into lateral ventricles of the brain in patients with Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). The treatment was well tolerated. At 12 weeks, the levels of p-Tau and beta amyloid were reduced. Results of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) trended toward improved cognition in two of three subjects. The data were presented at the 17th Clinical Trials on Alzheimer’s Disease (CTAD) conference in Madrid from 3 to 5 p.m. CET, October 29 and 30, 2024.

“Results from the first dose cohort increase our confidence in the safety of our RB-ADSC product candidate in Alzheimer’s disease patients,” said Christopher Duma, M.D., F.A.C.S., president, founder of RBI and presenter of the data. “In addition, improvements in Alzheimer’s disease biomarkers and an improving trend in a cognitive measure at up to 12 weeks are consistent with our hypothesis that infusion of Wnt-activated stem cells into the brain may initiate a cessation or reversal of at least some of the pathological processes underlying this devastating disease. We have completed enrollment of our second dose cohort and we are progressing enrollment with our third and final dose cohort. We look forward to presenting the full data set at future medical conferences.”

The Phase 1 open-label, single-arm study is enrolling nine subjects over approximately one year randomized into a 3 + 3 single dose escalation design to evaluate the safety of autologous RB-ADSC infused into the lateral ventricles of the brain in subjects with mild-to-moderate AD, and to determine a recommended dose for a potential Phase 2 clinical trial. Secondary endpoints include AD clinical assessments and biochemical and anatomical biomarkers. Each participant will be followed for up to 52 months after treatment. More information on the clinical trial can be found at NCT05667649.

RB-ADSCs are Wnt-activated adipose-derived stem cells obtained from a patient’s own adipose tissue. After collection, the stem cells are cultured and expanded in vitro, selected for Wnt expression, which is a signaling protein known to stimulate stem cells to communicate with other stem cells, and then reintroduced into the same patient via an Ommaya reservoir implanted under the scalp, which has direct access to the lateral ventricles located in the brain.

The treatment, including the liposuction procedure to obtain adipose-derived stem cells, was well tolerated with reported minor adverse events including minor bruising and discomfort post-liposuction and mild incisional pain following Ommaya reservoir implantation. The injection process, which required an average of eight minutes to perform without anesthetic, was well tolerated with no reported adverse events for at least 11 weeks post injection, including headache or nausea. CSF analysis in all three patients at 12 weeks showed a decrease in p-Tau from a median of 60.2 pg/ml (range: 59.2-76.1) to a median of 36.8 (range 27.3-46.2, normal). Pre-injection amyloid PET scan centiloid median score was reduced from 138.5 (range 54.2-155.5 to a median of 100.5 (range 55.6-104.0) at 12 weeks. MMSE scores improved by week 12 from a pre-injection median of 17 (range: 16-18) to a median of 19.5 (range: 19-20) in two and three evaluable patients.

However, if for some reason Strickland — who is known for reckless behavior outside the octagon — can’t fight, Chimaev is the logical next choice.

Chimaev has accused the top middleweights of running from his smashing style, but it’s unlikely that Du Plessis would shy away. Still Knocks has indicated he’s willing to fight anyone, including Strickland, light heavyweight champion Alex Pereira, Whittaker and now Chimaev.

Strickland also appears to be assuming he’ll get to fight Chimaev. Tarzan has already started trash talking with the Chechen on X, while warning him to wait his turn.

Whether the American would want to take on Chimaev after a hypothetical win against Du Plessis remains to be seen. Chimaev claims to have manhandled Strickland when the two trained together. Assuming that’s true, Strickland would justifiably be wary.

Whatever happens, though, the UFC’s middleweight division is poised for an exciting 2025. Any combination of Du Plessis, Strickland and Chimaev, in any order, will be must-see action."

Kirk, 27, sustained the injury when attempting to reel in a pass from quarterback Trevor Lawrence. As Kirk braced for his fall after corralling the ball, Packers linebacker Edgerrin Cooper tackled Kirk, who landed directly on his left shoulder. Kirk stayed on the ground and immediately grabbed for his left shoulder with his right arm.

Kirk caught two passes for 59 yards before being ruled out of the game. He was later seen wearing a sling after the loss.

The seventh-year receiver will finish his 2024 campaign with 25 receptions for 320 yards and a touchdown.

The Arizona Cardinals selected Kirk with the No. 47 pick in the 2018 NFL Draft. He signed with Jacksonville as an unrestricted free agent in 2022.

1028,2024-10-28 02:03:00,The Jets' fifth straight loss exposed weakness of entire team,https://www.yardbarker.com/nfl/articles/the_jets_fifth_straight_loss_exposed_weakness_of_entire_team/s1_13132_41134211,Sports,"As has become the norm this season, the New York Jets are leaving a week disappointed and confused. On Sunday, the Jets lost 25-22 to the lowly New England Patriots. Years ago, a close loss to the Patriots may have energized the Jets, but this latest loss simply shows they are a long way from where they expected to be this year.

New York has now lost five straight, with a Sept. 19 victory over the Patriots as its last win. While some of its losses during this steak have been to contending teams like the Steelers and Vikings, its sixth overall loss of the season came to a New England team forced to turn to career backup Jacoby Brissett after starter Drake Maye left the game with an injury.

Not only did the Jets lose once again, it's how they lost. After throwing an uncharacteristic amount of interceptions through the first seven games — seven to be exact — the man Jets fans believed was their savior, Aaron Rodgers, had one of his better games of the entire season against New England. Unfortunately for long-suffering Jets fans, it didn't matter.

Rodgers completed 17-of-28 passes for 233 yards with a pair of touchdown passes and no picks. He also averaged 8.3 yards per completion (his second-highest total for a single game in 2024) and a quarterback rating of 111.2. By any metric, Rodgers played well enough for a good team to win.

The issue is, and they may even be realizing this themselves, the Jets are just not a good team. New York's once stellar defense, a unit that was ranked No. 2 in the NFL when head coach and defensive guru Robert Saleh was fired on Oct. 8, allowed the Patriots to win the time of possession battle and gave up 18 second-half points as the Jets blew another lead.

Beyond the defense, especially the run defense that gave up three rushing touchdowns on the day, falling off, the weapons around Rodgers haven't been stripping up either. Breece Hall averaged 5.0 yards per carry but only finished with 80 yards and coughed up a fumble. And for the most disappointing problem, reuniting Davante Adams with Rodgers has only resulted in seven receptions for 84 yards in two games.

To be fair, it's also not just about who's not doing enough or making mistakes around Rodgers either. While Rodgers was fine in Week 8, he was coming off a ""Sunday Night Football"" loss in Pittsburgh that saw undrafted rookie Beanie Bishop pick him off twice in a 37-15 loss to the Steelers. In fact, six of Rodgers' seven interceptions so far during the 2024 season were thrown in the three weeks leading up to Sunday.

Rodgers' 2024 quarterback rating sits at a pedestrian 49.7, placing him at 23rd across the league. His 12 touchdown passes don't balance out his interceptions nearly enough.

Simply put, the Jets have endured 99 problems, and Rodgers has been one of them this year. And if the Adams trade didn't spark the offense and breathe new life into a sinking ship, it's unlikely anything will at this point.

Some may believe the Jets still have a chance because they are led by a four-time MVP and the Bills are the only team with a winning record in the AFC East, but it's becoming clear they can lose to anybody.

Math is also against the Jets. Now, at 2-6, the Jets are falling too far behind to even get back in the wild-card race. With two hot teams in the Texans and Cardinals on deck, the odds are just stacked against the Jets figuring anything out in time to make a playoff push, let alone make a run at a championship."

The Associated Press

Miami edged ahead of Texas and climbed to No. 5 in The Associated Press Top 25 college football poll on Sunday, its highest ranking since 2017, and Notre Dame, BYU and Texas A&M all moved into the top 10.

Oregon, Georgia, Penn State and Ohio State remained the top four teams, and Washington State and Colorado entered the Top 25 for the first time this season.

Led by Heisman Trophy candidate Cam Ward, Miami improved to 8-0 with its win over Florida State on Saturday. The Hurricanes have been in the top 10 eight straight polls but not this high since they spent two weeks at No. 2 in November 2017.

Texas, which had dropped from No. 1 to No. 5 after its home loss to Georgia, slipped another spot to No. 6 following a three-point win at Vanderbilt.

Notre Dame, knocked out of the top 10 after its Week 2 loss to Northern Illinois, moved up four spots and is No. 8 following its 51-14 win over Navy.

No. 9 BYU went on the road and beat UCF to go 8-0 and has its highest ranking since 2020, when the Cougars opened with nine straight wins.

Texas A&M’s 38-23 win over LSU was its second of the season against a top-10 opponent, and first-year coach Mike Elko’s Aggies were rewarded with a four-rung promotion to No. 10. That’s their highest ranking since they were sixth in September 2022.

No. 1 Oregon received 61 of 62 first-place votes — two more than last week — after a 38-9 win over Illinois. No. 2 Georgia, which was idle, received the other first-place vote.

Penn State overcame the loss of quarterback Drew Allar to injury just before halftime to win at Wisconsin and remained No. 3 going into this weekend’s home game against Ohio State, which stayed No. 4 after scuffling to a 21-17 win at home against nearly four-touchdown-underdog Nebraska.

Poll points

Notre Dame and Texas A&M made the biggest upward moves. LSU’s drop from No. 8 to No. 16 was the biggest demotion.

BYU has risen in six consecutive polls since it entered at No. 22 on Sept. 22. Pittsburgh has moved up in four straight since it made its season debut at No. 22 on Oct. 6.

Because of Texas’ drop to No. 6, this is the first poll this season that the Southeastern Conference has had only one representative in the top five. This is the fourth straight week the Big Ten has had three of the top four teams.

Miami is the first Atlantic Coast Conference team in the top five since Florida State was No. 4 the first week of last December.

In-and-out

Washington State (7-1) beat San Diego State for its third straight win and entered at No. 22 to become the first ranked team this season from what remains of the Pac-12 (Oregon State is the only other current member).

Colorado (6-2) has won five of six after beating Cincinnati and is No. 23, the first ranking for Deion Sanders and his Buffaloes since they appeared in three straight polls early last season.

Vanderbilt’s first ranking since the 2013 season lasted just one week. The Commodores, who had been No. 25, received the most votes among teams outside the Top 25.

Navy, in the poll two straight weeks, was knocked out after committing six turnovers in its 37-point loss to Notre Dame. Rival Army (7-0) climbed two spots to No. 21.

Conference call

SEC — 8 (Nos. 2, 6, 7, 10, 14, 16, 19, 25).

Big Ten — 5 (Nos. 1, 3, 4, 13, 24).

ACC — 4 (Nos. 5, 11, 18, 20).

Big 12 — 4 (Nos. 9, 11, 17, 23).

American — 1 (No. 21).

Independent — 1 (No. 8).

Mountain West — 1 (No. 15).

Pac-12 — 1 (No. 22).

Ranked vs. Ranked

— No. 4 Ohio State at No. 3 Penn State. This will be the fourth meeting of top five teams this season. Buckeyes have won seven straight in the series. Both teams have health issues, none bigger than the knee injury to Penn State’s Allar.

— No. 18 Pittsburgh at No. 20 SMU. Of the four teams unbeaten in ACC play, these two are the biggest surprises. Pitt was picked 13th in the conference in the preseason media poll and SMU seventh.

Nick Suzuki and Brendan Gallagher each notched a goal and an assist to help the visiting Montreal Canadiens hold on for a 4-3 victory over the Philadelphia Flyers on Sunday evening.

Jake Evans and Cole Caufield also scored and Cayden Primeau made 23 saves for the Canadiens, who have won consecutive games for the first time this season. They also earned their first road victory in three tries.

Travis Sanheim scored twice and Travis Konecny also had a goal for the Flyers, who have won just twice in their first nine games. Aleksei Kolosov made his NHL debut in net and finished with 20 saves.

Montreal scored three times in the second period to open a 4-1 lead.

The Canadiens initially jumped ahead 2-1 as a shot by Logan Mailloux caromed off Gallagher's leg and past a helpless Kolosov for Gallagher's third goal of the season.

Eight minutes later, Caufield extended Montreal's lead with a power-play goal. He gloved a loose puck near the left circle, dropped the puck and snapped a wrister inside the left post for his eighth goal of the season.

Just over three minutes later, Evans' one-timer from a sharp angle beat Kolosov to make it 4-1.

Sanheim made things interesting with 2:12 remaining in the contest, beating Primeau from the slot after a nice individual effort to create some space. Konency's goal with 1:43 to play created some stressful moments for the Canadiens, who survived heavy pressure in the final minute to earn the victory.

Each team scored once in the first period.

Suzuki opened the scoring at 10:42 with his third goal of the season. Sanheim drew Philadelphia even late in the period with a shot from the left point that Primeau was unable to fight through a screen."

In a story fitting for Halloween, however, authorities have finally unraveled a mystery regarding her skull. As NPR explains, the mystery began in 1978 when a homeowner in Batavia, Illinois, ripped down a wall and found a human skull inside. Authorities could not identify it, however, and it went into storage at the Batavia Depot Museum. There it sat, forgotten, until workers found it inside a box in 2021, per NBC News . Detectives retrieved DNA and eventually tracked down a great-great-grandson to confirm the skull belonged to Esther, per the AP .

As it turns out, her life ended as a teenager. Esther was born in 1848 in Indiana, got married at age 16, and died the following year from complications of childbirth after delivering a baby girl. ""So the question remains: If she died in 1866 in Indiana, how did she end up in a wall in a house in Batavia?"" says Rob Russell, coroner of Kane County in Illinois. Detectives can't say for sure, but they have an educated guess: Grave robbers. At the time Esther died, the practice was relatively common because grave robbers could make a nice profit by selling remains to physicians who were trying to learn more about anatomy.

""There is this sense of closure,"" says Esther's newly identified descendant, 69-year-old Wayne Svilar of Portland, Oregon. ""I wish my mom were here so I could tell her the story, she would have loved it."" (More strange stuff stories.)"

In late September, the governor of the state of Oklahoma, Kevin Stitt, boasted that election officials had removed 453,000 people from the state's voter rolls since 2021. In a state with only 2.3 million registered voters, it appears that roughly one in six registered voters had been purged.

While some of these people were dead or disfranchised owing to felony convictions, nearly 200,000 of them were removed for being ""inactive voters."" This means they likely failed to respond to a postcard sent to their mailing address.

Voters can re-register if they were incorrectly removed, but this ""voter list maintenance"" process still creates a barrier to democratic participation.

Unsurprisingly, Oklahoma historically has one of the lowest voter turnout rates in the United States.

This bucks the national trend. Overall, across the United States, electoral turnout has increased in presidential and midterm elections since 2018. Americans feel, now more than ever, that elections have high stakes.

And some states have made it easier to vote. Minnesota, for example, allows voters to register online or at the polls on Election Day.

In states like Oklahoma, however, voters are discouraged or demoralized by policies and laws meant to make voting difficult and time-consuming. Legislatures in these states have been emboldened over the past decade by a series of Supreme Court rulings voiding key parts of the Voting Rights Act.

These states are now the new fronts in the unfinished battle to secure one of the fundamental elements of democracy—the right to vote. We've analyzed data on voter turnout and voting accessibility across the US and found that states restricting access the most are overwhelmingly led by Republican legislatures.

A long history of voter disenfranchisement

US elections have always been the domain of the states. And state legislatures have long wielded this power to discriminate against marginalized groups.

Prior to the Civil War, most states restricted the right to vote to white men. Then, in 1870, the 15th Amendment to the Constitution was ratified, which forbade states from restricting the right to vote on the basis of ""race, color or previous condition of servitude""

In practice, however, this didn't change things in all states. In the South, where Jim Crow laws maintained segregation in many facets of public life, lawmakers found other ways to disenfranchise Black voters.

These methods included poll taxes, literacy tests, and grandfather clauses. In some Southern states, Democrats also held all-white primaries to prohibit Black voters from participating. They claimed that political parties were private organizations and not subject to the 15th Amendment.

When other methods failed, white people used violence and intimidation to discourage Black voters from showing up at the polls.

Women made gains state by state in the decades following the Civil War, though Black women in the South were disenfranchised alongside Black men. This made white women the primary beneficiaries of the 19th Amendment, ratified in 1920. This dictated that states could not withhold voting rights ""on account of sex"".

It was not until the ratification of the 24th Amendment in 1964, which prohibited the use of the poll tax, and the 1965 Voting Rights Act, which outlawed the literacy tests, that American democracy could begin to live up to its name.

How states are erecting more barriers

However, even these landmark developments have not ensured that voting is easy or universally accessible to all Americans.

In fact, many states have accelerated efforts to police voting rolls and enact hurdles to civic engagement in the wake of then-President Donald Trump's false claims of voter fraud in the 2020 election. Republican-dominated states like Oklahoma have been particularly keen to adopt restrictive policies.

According to the Center for Public Integrity, 26 states have made voting less accessible since 2020. These barriers include many tactics:

Partisan redistricting also discourages members of minority parties from turning out on Election Day. By drawing district lines that clearly favor one party over another, such practices can make people feel it is pointless to vote.

What our research found

According to our calculations, out of the states that have made voting less accessible since 2020, most are located in the South (43%) or Midwest (31%). The data reveal the most significant losses in voting access have occurred in southern states with large populations of Black voters.

The most restrictive lawmaking has been spearheaded by Republican-dominated state legislatures, with 86% of such states passing inequitable voting barriers. In contrast, only 5% of Democratic-led states have made voting harder.

In addition, according to our research, high barriers to voting are directly related to lower voter turnout rates.

When all states were analyzed, ""high barrier"" states had an average turnout rate of 45.8% compared to 49% for ""low barrier"" states in the 2022 election, a statistically significant difference. The average turnout rate across all US states in 2022 was 46.2%.

In the South, most states (11 of 16) made voting more difficult after the 2020 election—and nearly all had voter turnout rates well below the national average in 2022. (Mississippi was the lowest at 32.5%.)

High-barrier southern states with Republican-led legislatures had an average turnout rate of 40.6%, compared to 46.2% in high-barrier, Republican-led states in other regions.

Three states in low-barrier states, meanwhile, had turnout rates above 60%—Oregon, Maine and Minnesota. All had Democratic-majority legislatures, or in the case of Minnesota, a divided legislature and Democratic governor.

States should motivate voters, not demoralize them

These policies to restrict voting accessibility, draped in the cloak of ""election security,"" will no doubt affect turnout in certain states in the upcoming November elections, as well.

Research shows Americans choose to vote because they think it is their civic duty or they believe the outcome of an election matters for their community, nation or self.

Yet, staying home on Election Day is also a rational behavior since the chances of being the pivotal voter that decides an election is estimated at one in one million in a battleground state and much less in a noncompetitive state.

With national voter turnout already low compared to other democracies, state legislatures should be doing what they can to motivate voters and make it easier for them to cast a ballot—not making it more difficult for them to do so.

Antibiotic resistance is a growing public health problem around the world. When bacteria like E. coli no longer respond to antibiotics, infections become harder to treat.

To develop new antibiotics, researchers typically identify the genes that make bacteria resistant. Through laboratory experiments, they observe how bacteria respond to different antibiotics and look for mutations in the genetic makeup of resistant strains that allow them to survive.

While effective, this method can be time-consuming and may not always capture the full picture of how bacteria become resistant. For example, changes in how genes work that don't involve mutations can still influence resistance. Bacteria can also exchange resistance genes between each other, which may not be detected if only focusing on mutations within a single strain.

My colleagues and I developed a new approach to identify E. coli resistance genes by computer modeling, allowing us to design new compounds that can block these genes and make existing treatments more effective.

Identifying resistance

To predict which genes contribute to resistance, we analyzed the genomes of various E. coli strains to identify genetic patterns and markers associated with resistance. We then used machine learning algorithms trained on existing data to highlight novel genes or mutations shared across resistant strains that might contribute to resistance.

After identifying resistance genes, we designed inhibitors that specifically target and block the proteins these genes produce. By analyzing the structure of the proteins these genes code for, we were able to optimize our inhibitors to strongly bind to these specific proteins.

To reduce the likelihood that bacteria would evolve resistance to these inhibitors, we targeted regions of their genome that code for proteins critical to their survival. By interfering with how bacteria carry out important functions, it makes it more difficult for them to develop mechanisms to compensate. We also prioritized compounds that work differently from existing antibiotics to minimize cross-resistance.

Finally, we tested how effectively our inhibitors could overcome antibiotic resistance in E. coli. We used computer simulations to assess how strongly a number of inhibitors bind to target proteins over time. One inhibitor called hesperidin was able to strongly bind to the three genes in E. coli involved in resistance that we identified, suggesting it may be able to help combat antibiotic-resistant strains.

A global threat

The World Health Organization ranks antimicrobial resistance as one of the top 10 threats to global health. In 2019, bacterial antibiotic resistance killed an estimated 4.95 million people worldwide.

By targeting the specific genes responsible for resistance to existing drugs, our approach could lead to treatments for challenging bacterial infections that are not only more effective but also less likely to contribute to further resistance. It can also help researchers keep up with bacterial threats as they evolve.

Our predictive approach could be adapted to other bacterial strains, allowing for more personalized treatment strategies. In the future, doctors could potentially tailor antibiotic treatments based on the specific genetic makeup of the bacteria causing the infection, potentially leading to better outcomes.

As antibiotic resistance continues to rise globally, our findings may provide a crucial tool in the fight against this threat. Further development is needed before our methods can be used in the clinic. But by staying ahead of bacterial evolution, targeted inhibitors could help preserve the efficacy of existing antibiotics and reduce the spread of resistant strains.

1031,2024-10-31 14:06:30,CAS Space of China aims to go international,https://spacenews.com/cas-space-of-china-aims-to-go-international/,Technology,"HELSINKI — Commercial launch provider CAS Space is looking to enter international markets to secure its long-term growth.

CAS Space, a commercial spinoff from the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), has established itself with its Kinetica-1 (Lijian-1) solid rocket, which has launched four times, including a 2022 debut flight, all successfully. Its main customer is Changguang Satellite Technology (CGST), another commercial CAS entity building an Earth observation constellation.

The upcoming Kinetica-2 rocket, currently set for launch in September 2025, will enhance CAS Space’s payload capabilities to reach broader client needs, offering up to 7,800 kilograms to sun-synchronous orbit and 12,000 kg low Earth orbit. Potential recovery tests for reuse are planned at the end of 2026. It recently secured a role launching a low-cost cargo transportation system to the Tiangong space station, and is aiming to offer suborbital tourist flights by 2027.

CAS Space plans 5-8 launches next year, with 2-3 Kinetica-2 launches also booked. But the company is looking to expand to offer its services globally.

“There is lots of competition going on right now, and our perspective is that we have to have a really big market here [in China], but it’s not big enough for all these large companies,” Liu Weipeng, CAS Space international marketing manager, told SpaceNews at the 75th International Astronautical Congress in Milan, Oct. 17.

CAS Space faces competition for launch contracts for constellations such as Guowang and Thousand Sails (Qianfan) and commercial plans from not only fellow startups including Landspace, Galactic Energy, Space Pioneer, iSpace and Deep Blue Aerospace, but also the state-owned main space contractor CASC and its Long March rockets. It now faces competition for the potential suborbital tourism market in China, with Deep Blue Aerospace selling two seats for 2027 flights.

“So for a company like ourselves to grow, it’s important for us to expand to global clients,” Liu said.

Part of that effort was a presence at IAC, which saw more than 11,000 participants. But entering the market is challenging on a number of fronts, including U.S. International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) and other export controls, but also competition.

“It’s difficult,” Liu said, on trying to make inroads internationally. “I would say it will be rewarding, but it will be a very difficult first step, especially if you know all the regulations in place.” Liu adds that ITAR has almost entirely barred CAS Space from the American and European markets.

Competition from SpaceX, with its Transporter missions, is also stated as a major hurdle for gaining international contracts. There is also the issue of perception regarding the Chinese launch sector.

“There’s a misconception, I would say, that the Chinese companies are obscured. They’re not transparent enough. It’s something that we do often see,” says Liu. “But as a commercial company, into global markets, we want to change that perspective.” Part of this includes being active on X, formerly Twitter, posting updates and even responding to questions. Ciao! CAS Space is at Milan for IAC 2024. Feel free to drop in at our booth (MS-F03) anytime! pic.twitter.com/10XxHyy2xV — CAS Space (@cas_space) October 14, 2024

The company appears to have a blend of government support, private investment, commercial revenues, and strategic partnerships, including support from CAS. When the company raised $31 million in 2021, leading investors were CITIC Juxin, ultimately owned by state-owned investment company CITIC Group Corporation, Zhongke Chuangxing, an accelerator fund set up by CAS, and Yuexiu Industrial Investment, another state-owned investment vehicle, operating in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area.

CAS Space currently launches from Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in the Gobi Desert, northwest China. But it is looking to expand to the new commercial Hainan spaceport near Wenchang. This, and a plan to begin sea launches next year, may provide more flexibility.

Related to this, the company also plans to use cruise ships off the coast of Wenchang to view launches from Wenchang commercial spaceport. The move is related to its wider space tourism plans, with suborbital missions and CAS Space in 2022 entering into a partnership with the China Tourism Group.

Before this, CAS Space is looking to secure a Chinese commercial first. “We have potential partners. We have a few projects ongoing, so we wish to make the first step for the Chinese commercial Chinese space launch industry, to the global space market,” Liu said. “Hopefully, very soon, the next couple of launches, we will have a few payloads from other countries.”"

Wayne County Sheriff Dean Finch said in a news release that Larry Musgraves Jr., 57, was arrested Friday evening on the ABM Ministries campus in Piedmont, a small town 130 miles south of St. Louis. Carmen Musgraves, 64, was arrested around 3am Saturday when she came to the jail to check on her husband, Finch said. Both have been charged with first-degree kidnapping and jailed without bond, the AP reports.

A former principal at a Christian boarding school in Missouri that closed in March amid abuse allegations has been charged with sex crimes involving a former student. Craig Wesley Smith Jr. has been charged with forcible sodomy and attempted forcible rape, court records show. He is accused of forcing a teen girl to perform sex acts in the late 2000s when she was a student at Lighthouse Christian Academy. A probable cause statement alleged that Smith told the girl he would kill her and ""make it look like she committed suicide"" if she told anyone, the AP reports. The school's husband-and-wife owners, Larry and Carmen Musgrave, were charged with first-degree kidnapping for allegedly locking a student in a room, but a judge dismissed the charges on Oct. 15.

ABM Ministries' website says its facility, operated as Lighthouse Christian Academy, is a private Christian boarding school for boys ages 10-13, situated on 250 acres that include a spring-fed pond and a pasture with animals. Finch said that since early January, his office has received reports of five runaways from the school. In one instance, two boys were picked up by a neighboring resident and taken home. The boys asked her to call 911. But Finch said his investigation began several months ago after he was contacted by a former student living in Alabama. He followed up by interviewing other former students and eventually the current students.

story continues below

The sheriff's department ""anticipates more charges as the investigation continues, with more alleged victims coming forward,"" the news release stated. The school was coed in 2009 when a federal lawsuit accused a former principal of sex acts with a female student and alleged that the Musgraveses failed to take action to protect the girl. Court records show that ABM Ministries and the Musgraveses agreed to pay $750,000 in a settlement, and the principal agreed to pay $100,000. Former students say justice was long overdue. Juliana Davis, now 34, says she was abused at the school in 2006 and 2007. ""I'm glad that he took us seriously,"" Davis says of Finch. ""There's a whole group of us that have been trying for decades, speaking out about what happened to us and what we saw.""

The fund is backed by Saison Capital, Expert Dojo, and Frekaz Group. The fund has already deployed capital into seven initial projects aimed at expanding the Redacted ecosystem, offering founders critical support on go-to-market strategies and tokenomics development.

Announced during Redacted Airways, a Web3 event in the air, the fund seeks to invest and support the next generation of decentralized applications across entertainment, decentralized finance and infrastructure, as part of the Redacted Ecosystem’s growing portfolio of products.

“The Redacted Fund was born out of our viral event with Qatar Airways in September, hosting 300 of Web3’s top venture capital funds, angel investors and influencers such as Aethir founder Mark Rydon, NFT whale Grail, and personalities like Mario Nawfal, the Crypto Banter team, and Andres Meneses,” said Shanjan Kumar, CEO of Redacted. “At the main event on the flight, we invited more than a dozen founders to pitch. These seven companies were shortlisted as a result of highly positive feedback, including participating judges from Animoca Brands, Polygon, and Abu Dhabi Blockchain. After further due diligence, we decided to invest in these startups.”

The fund will offer Redacted’s upcoming token – RDAC, as a catalyst for growth. The seven startups that received investment are Biptap, LegendaryWeb3, Hub.xz, Numa social, Spaace.io, Ammalgam and iAgentProtocol.

“Biptap is excited to be a part of the Redacted Ecosystem. Biptap has made leaps and bounds on the growth of our platform and in our strategic partnerships, and we are thankful to have already received support and investment from Redacted given their incredible network and their strategic insight on how to succeed in web3,” said Jonathan Low, CEO and founder of Biptap, in a statement.

According to Kumar, founders who work with the Redacted Fund can expect support not just in the form of capital, but also tokenomics. Redacted will allocate a portion of its upcoming RDAC Token to The Redacted Fund’s portfolio companies. The token serves as additional incentives for portfolio companies to catalyse growth, as well as validation of product market fit as they leverage the RDAC Token to refine and iterate their products.

Post-investment, the Redacted Fund will offer portfolio companies in-depth go-to market support, drawing on a bench of seasoned advisors across web2 and web3.

Backed by global Web3 team PG Group, Redacted has secured more than $10 million in funding from prominent investors and web3 founders, including Animoca Brands, Spartan Group, Saison Capital, Polygon Ventures, Dingaling, and Yat Siu."
1031,2024-10-31 14:00:00,Vampire Bats Have Unique Adaptations and Relationships,https://www.discovermagazine.com/planet-earth/vampire-bats-have-unique-adaptations-and-relationships,Science,"You can probably picture a vampire: Pale, sharply fanged undead sucker of blood, deterred only by sunlight, religious paraphernalia, and garlic. They’re gnarly creatures, often favorite subjects for movies or books. Luckily, they’re only imaginary … or are they?

There are real vampires in the world of bats. Out of over 1,400 currently described bat species, three are known to feed on blood exclusively.

The common vampire bat, Desmodus rotundus, is the most abundant. At home in the tropical forests of Central and South America, these bats feed on various animals, including tapirs, mountain lions, penguins, and, most often nowadays, livestock.

(Credit: Nicolas Reusens/Moment via Getty Images) A vampire bat enjoys a blood meal at the expense of a domestic goat.

Feeding on a blood diet is unusual for a mammal and has led to many unique adaptations that facilitate their uncommon lifestyle. Unlike other bats, vampires are mobile on the ground, toggling between two distinct gaits to circle their sleeping prey. Heat-sensing receptors on their noses help them find warm blood under their prey’s skin. Finally, the combination of a small incision, made by potentially self-sharpening fangs, and an anticoagulant in their saliva allow these bats to feed on unsuspecting prey.

To me, as a behavioral ecologist who is interested in how pathogens affect social behaviors and vice versa, the most fascinating adaptations to a blood-feeding lifestyle are observable in vampire bats’ social lives.

Vampire Bats Build Reciprocal Relationships

Blood is not very nutritious, and vampire bats that fail to feed will starve relatively quickly. If a bat returns to the roost hungry, others may regurgitate a blood meal to get them through the night.

(Credit: Gerry Carter) Vampire bats will share their blood meal with a hungry friend.

Such food sharing happens between bats who are related – such as mothers and their offspring – but also unrelated individuals. This observation has puzzled evolutionary biologists for quite a while. Why help someone who is not closely related to you?

It turns out that vampire bats keep track of who feeds them and reciprocate – or not if the other bat has not been helpful in the past. In doing so, they form complex social relationships maintained by low-cost social investments, such as cleaning and maintaining the fur of another animal, called allogrooming, and higher-cost social investments, such as sharing food.

These relationships are on par with what you would see in primates, and some people compare them to human friendships. Indeed, there are some parallels.

For instance, humans will raise the stakes when forming new relationships with others. You start with social investments that don’t cost much – think sharing some of your lunch – and wait for the other person’s response. If they don’t reciprocate, the relationship may be doomed. But if the other person does reciprocate by sharing a bit of their dessert, for instance, your next investment might be larger. You gradually increase the stakes in a game of back-and-forth until the friendship eventually warrants larger social investments like going out of your way to give them a ride to work when their car breaks down.

Vampire bats do the same. When strangers are introduced, they will start with small fur-cleaning interactions to test the waters. If both partners keep reciprocating and raising the stakes, the relationship will eventually escalate to food sharing, which is a bigger commitment.

Relationships in Sickness and in Health

My lab studies how infections affect social behaviors and relationships. Given their vast array of social behaviors and the complexity of their social relationships, vampire bats are the ideal study system for me and my colleagues.

How does being ill affect how vampire bats behave? How do other bats behave toward one that is sick? How does sickness affect the formation and maintenance of their social relationships?

We simulate infections in bats in our lab by using molecules derived from pathogens to stimulate an immune response. We’ve repeatedly found a form of passive social distancing where sick individuals reduce their interaction with others, whether it’s allogrooming, social calling, or just spending time near others.

(Credit: Sherri and Brock Fenton) Researchers attach proximity sensors to bats. The sensors communicate with each other and exchange information about meeting time, duration and signal strength, which is a proxy for distance between two bats.

Importantly, these behavioral changes haven’t necessarily evolved to minimize spreading disease to others. Rather, they are parts of the complex immune response that biologists call sickness behaviors. It’s comparable to someone infected with the flu staying at home simply because they don’t feel up to venturing out. Even if such passive social distancing may have not evolved to prevent transmission to others, simply being too sick to interact with others will still reduce the spread of germs.

Interestingly, sickness behaviors can be suppressed. People do this all the time. So-called presenteeism is showing up at work despite illness due to various pressures. Similarly, many people have suppressed symptoms of an infection to engage in some sort of social obligation. If you have little kids, you know that when everyone in your household is coming down with something, there’s no way you can just sit back and not take care of the little ones, even if you feel quite bad yourself.

Animals are no different. They can suppress sickness behaviors when competing needs arise, such as caring for young or defending territory. Despite their tendency to reduce social interactions with others when sick, in vampire bats, sick mothers will continue to groom their offspring and vice versa, probably because mother-daughter relationships are extra important. Mothers and daughters are often each other’s primary social relationships within groups of vampire bats.

(Credit: Sherri and Brock Fenton) Despite vampire bats’ elaborate social relationships, farmers often consider them pests.

Human-Bat Conflict Centers on Livestock

Despite their many fascinating adaptations and complex social lives, vampire bats are not universally admired. In fact, in many areas in South and Central America, they are considered pests because they can transmit the deadly rabies virus to livestock, which can cause quite significant economic losses.

Before people introduced livestock into their habitat, vampire bats probably had a harder time finding food in the form of native prey species such as tapirs. Now, livestock has become their primary food source. After all, why not feed on something that is reliably at the same place every night and quite abundant? Increases in livestock abundance come with increases in vampire bat populations, probably perpetuating the problem of rabies transmission.

The farmers’ quarrels with vampires make sense, especially in smaller cattle herds, where losing even one cow can significantly hurt a farmer’s livelihood. Culling campaigns have used topically applied poisons called vampiricide, basically a mix of petroleum jelly and rat poison. Bats are caught, the paste is applied to the fur, and they carry it back to the roost, where others ingest the poison during social interactions. Interestingly, large-scale culling may not be very effective in reducing rabies spillover.

Now, the focus has started to shift toward large-scale cattle vaccinations or vaccinating the vampire bats themselves. Researchers are even considering transmissible vaccines: They could genetically modify herpes viruses, which are quite common in vampire bats, to carry rabies genes and vaccinate large swaths of vampire bat populations.

Whichever method is used to mitigate vampire-bat-human conflicts, more empathy for these misunderstood animals could only help. After all, if you stick your head into a hollow tree full of vampire bats – assuming you can brave the smell of digested blood – remember: You’re looking at a complex network of individual friendships between animals that care deeply for each other.

The KOR Protocol, whose initial developer is owned by Web3 gaming firm Animoca Brands, aims to improve how how intellectual property from music to other interactive art is managed, distributed, and monetized within artist communities.

British recording artist and Grammy award-winner Imogen Heap, electronic music icons deadmau5,

Richie Hawtin, and Disclosure, and masters of multimedia experiences Dixon, whose Transmoderna art collective is known for its immersive live-shows, will help oversee the direction of the protocol and advise on supporting artists, musicians, filmmakers, and developers in protecting their creations and engaging directly with their audiences.

Global recorded music revenues rose 10.2% in 2023 to $28.6 billion led by online streaming services, marking the ninth year of consecutive growth for the music industry. Yet despite the undeniable profits

made by global megastars like Taylor Swift or Ed Sheeran, the majority of artists struggle to make a

living from their music alone.

According to a survey by Xposure Music, just 11% of independent artists earn income solely through their music. A major issue is the low payout rates, which can be as little as $0.004 to $0.008 per stream. Additionally, streaming platforms like Spotify and Apple Music keep a significant portion of the revenue, with record labels also taking hefty cuts, leaving artists with a small portion of the pie.

KOR Protocol addresses this imbalance, changing how intellectual property is managed, distributed, and monetized, enabling artists and creators to receive fair pay for their work and engage directly with their fans and communities. Offering a unique infrastructure for creators with a range of AI-powered tools and applications, artists can easily create interactive experiences and release into new products that resonate with global fan communities. Adding such highly regarded world-renowned artists as advisors underscores KOR Protocol’s commitment to empowering creators with next-generation technology—and the best possible direction from leaders in their respective fields.

Heap is passionate about creating a decentralized database where songs act as services, giving direct access to all their details. Through her various initiatives, including Creative Passport and Auracles and collaborations with platforms such as KOR, she aims to open new opportunities and revenue streams for music makers, driving innovation in the industry. Electronic music icons deadmau5 and Richie Hawtin, known for their forward-thinking approaches to music and tech, have also previously explored the intersection of music, digital IP, and blockchain, cementing their advisory roles to help drive innovative content creation and fan engagement strategies.

Disclosure’s connection to remix culture will further help develop KOR’s vision of an ecosystem where artists can co-create and remix content without traditional limitations, reinforcing the platform’s mission to make the creation and management of music IP transparent, collaborative, and fair, and Dixon and his collective Transmoderna will be a leading guide on pushing the boundaries of immersive multimedia experiences, exploring the possibilities that arise from merging electronic music with transmedia art.

Inder Phull, creator of KOR Protocol, said in a statement, “This visionary team of artists are not only leaders in their fields but are passionate about creating new immersive experiences and fair compensation for artists. Under their expert guidance, KOR Protocol can provide the next generation of entertainment ecosystems for creators and fans alike.”

In addition to these artists, Ben Turner, co-founder of the International Music Summit and Association for Electronic Music, and Dean Wilson, CEO of Seven20 and manager of Deadmau5, will join the protocol as partners and advisors. Their extensive experience in the music and entertainment industries will help guide KOR Protocol’s development as a comprehensive platform for managing, distributing, and monetizing intellectual property.

Pixelynx, the first developer behind KOR Protocol was acquired by Animoca Brands, leaders in the Web3 and entertainment space. From IP registration, licensing, and royalty tracking to decentralized interactive content creation, KOR Protocol enables artists, developers, and fans to collaborate seamlessly shifting the paradigm of traditional IP management."

A team of computer scientists, astronomers and historians in Berlin has used machine-learning applications to learn more about the evolutionary history of European astronomical thought in the 15th and 16th centuries. In their study published in the journal Science Advances, the group trained machine-learning applications to make sense of hand-written texts, graphs, charts and other data from textbooks of the era.

Over the past several decades, scientists from many fields have come to understand that there were few if any individuals who came up with a truly novel idea out of the blue. This is most certainly the case with scientific achievements, including those made in fields such as astronomy.

In this new study, the researchers note that there were many scientists besides Galileo, Kepler and Copernicus who contributed to the evolution of astronomical thought during the 15th and 16th centuries in Europe, and along with that, the education of those new to the field.

Many such people, they note, created texts to capture their ideas and/or to present them to others, either professionally or as a textbook. The researchers gathered more than 300 such texts as part of a study to better understand how the field of astronomy evolved. But they knew it would take much too long for a small team of humans to study, so they turned to machine learning.

The researchers trained a machine-learning application on 76,000 pages from textbooks, which included tables of numbers, images, markings and text. They developed several ways to get the machine learning app to understand what it was supposed to retrieve (numbers as opposed to text, for example) and then what to do with the information.

Once they had all the data processed, the team used the app in reverse to look for trends, one of which was the huge impact of developments in mathematics on astronomy. They describe the process as the mathematization of the field, part of which included standardization of formulas used to calculate stellar positioning, changes in defined climate zones and a means for sharing what was being learned across the continent.

A team of computer scientists, ecologists and statisticians at Stony Brook University, working with a colleague from the U.S. Geological Survey, has found that it is possible to use AI applications to find images captured by ecotourists for use in studying remote animal species.

In their study, published in the open-access journal PLOS ONE, the group used a Segment Anything Model (SAM) to analyze imagery of Adélie penguins captured by ecotourists visiting the Antarctic.

In recent years, Adélie penguins have come to be known as a sentinel species, as they respond to changes in their environment due to global warming. But they are also a remote species, which means they are rarely studied in their environment.

The research team noted that two changes have occurred in recent years that could prove useful in studying the penguins. The first is the accessibility of cameras on smartphones. The second is the boom in ecotourism, comprising tours of remote places for average people. Ecotourists take a lot of pictures and/or videos of Adélie penguins.

The team concluded that a method to find such imagery and place it in context would be valuable for scientists, who could track the movements of colonies of the penguins over time. This would help them to learn more about the penguins, and also about climate changes occurring in the Antarctic.

The researchers developed and used a digital elevation model to align and register ground-based and satellite imagery. They then used the AI- based SAM for identification and segmentation purposes—it allowed for using context in the images to place the location of the penguins in their habitat.

By placing imagery in context, the researchers were able to track movements of colonies over time. They found that the penguins move around based on weather conditions, which gives clues about environmental warming. The team was also able to monitor colony size, which is affected by health conditions and the geographical conditions in which the penguins were living.

1031,2024-10-31 13:41:49,New doubt over production cuts in plastic pollution treaty,https://phys.org/news/2024-10-production-plastic-pollution-treaty.html,Science,"This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:

Nations hope to agree the world's first treaty to end plastic pollution later this year.

A global treaty to end plastic pollution may be in jeopardy, negotiators and environmentalists said Thursday, with new signs that countries may not be able to agree on production cuts.

A document circulated by the diplomat chairing the talks, and seen by AFP, includes no language urging production limits—considered key by many countries to a strong treaty.

The so-called non-paper is intended to help negotiators make progress in crunch negotiations next month in South Korea.

But countries remain far apart on many issues, and the current draft treaty is an unwieldy document that runs over 70 pages and is littered with contradictory positions.

The new document, however, raised alarm bells for some.

""We think that it is important to raise the level (of ambition) of the non-paper,"" warned French Ecology Minister Agnes Pannier-Runacher.

""Otherwise, we are not in agreement,"" she told reporters in Colombia on the sidelines of a biodiversity summit.

""Even if we become champions of recycling and waste collection, we will not solve the problem of plastic pollution if we do not reduce the use and production of virgin plastic.""

France is among the members of a so-called High Ambition Coalition pushing for a stronger treaty.

A negotiator from another member of the coalition, speaking on condition of anonymity, warned the non-paper's terms were so weak that ""we have doubts whether this would be a deal worth making.""

""I think this is an example of just extreme disregard for people's human health,"" he told AFP, accusing countries of blocking measures in a ""very well-coordinated strategy to avoid having their economic interests threatened.""

The key concern is the paper's section on production where chair Luis Vayas Valdivieso offers no proposed text, effectively conceding that positions on the issue remain too far apart.

Instead, he suggests countries agree to a ""process to address the current information gaps regarding existing and needed levels of production.""

The language reflects the deep divisions between countries like Rwanda that want stringent, binding language, and mostly oil-producing countries that prefer loose targets to be implemented at the discretion of each country.

That has left environmental groups deeply worried.

""Everyone knows that the only way to end plastic pollution is to stop making so much plastic,"" Graham Forbes, global plastics project leader for environmental group Greenpeace, told AFP.

""It will be up to political leaders in Busan to stand up to the fossil fuel industry and deliver a treaty that protects human health, biodiversity and the climate.""

WWF also warned the text needs a ""significant improvement in level of ambition"", including binding measures on hazardous chemicals and product design.

Negotiators have to decide whether to accept the non-paper as a basis for talks, though many agree the draft treaty is an unworkable starting point.

Countries will only have a week to bridge major divides on questions like whether to ban so-called ""problematic"" chemicals and plastic products, and how to finance the treaty's implementation.

That has raised concerns about pressure to ram through a weak treaty, with other observers suggesting negotiations could be extended, or even collapse.

Vayas Valdivieso has remained optimistic, insisting an agreement can be reached in Busan.

Is It Too Late to Buy?",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/billionaire-stanley-druckenmiller-bet-big-072100107.html,Business,"Stanley Druckenmiller is one of the greatest investors of all time. As the manager of Duquesne Capital Management for nearly three decades, from 1981 to 2010, he generated an average annual return of 30% and never had a losing year.

Druckenmiller also worked closely with George Soros, helping to ""break the Bank of England"" through a massive short bet on the pound in 1992.

These days, Druckenmiller is retired as a hedge fund manager, but he still manages his own money through the Duquesne Family Office, and the billionaire's moves are worth following. Druckenmiller was early to recognize the growth potential of Nvidia in artificial intelligence (AI), moving aggressively into the stock in Q4 2022 after ChatGPT was released, but he acknowledged recently that he sold it too early, dumping all of it earlier this year.

However, Druckenmiller made another smart buy earlier this year, buying 889,355 shares of Philip Morris International (NYSE: PM) and call options giving him the rights to buy another 963,000 shares of the tobacco stock.

Druckenmiller opened up a position in the stock in the second quarter, and though we don't know exactly when he bought the stock, we do know that he's up big on the dividend stock since then. Philip Morris has gained 30% since the end of the second quarter, an impressive feat for a high-yield dividend stock, and shares just surged on its third-quarter earnings report.

Let's take a look at those numbers and where the business is today before discussing whether it makes sense to follow Druckenmiller into the stock.

Philip Morris is on fire

Though smoking is in decline in much of the world, Philip Morris has adapted to that reality better than its two closest peers on the stock market, Altria and British American Tobacco.

Roughly 40% of its revenue now comes from next-gen products like its Iqos devices, which heat real tobacco without burning it, and Zyn, the popular oral nicotine pouches it gained in its acquisition of Swedish Match for $16 billion in 2022. It's invested in growth in both those categories, adding new plants to expand production of Zyn, and rolling out Iqos in the U.S.

That strength was on display in the company's third-quarter earnings report as Philip Morris blew past analyst estimates and the stock jumped 10.5% on Wednesday.

The tobacco company reported revenue of $9.91 billion, up 11.6% on an organic basis (meaning excluding the impact of currency exchange, divestitures, and acquisitions), and ahead of estimates of $9.69 billion. Organic revenue from its smoke-free business jumped 16.8% to $3.8 billion, and its combustibles business delivered 8.6% organic revenue growth thanks to rising prices and a 1.3% increase in cigarette volumes to 163.2 billion.

As for what's next, Wallschleger -- who has also been a stand-in and stunt double for other NFLers like the Watt Brothers and Zach Ertz in the past -- is now focused on his upcoming Lifetime movie ""Christmas in the Spotlight,"" which is about a pop superstar and football player falling in love (sound familiar??).

The project clearly took inspiration from Taylor Swift and the Kansas City Chiefs tight end's romance ... and Wallschleger -- a former football player himself -- wants all the Grammy winner's fans to appreciate what he brings to the table.

What, like having the perfect Halloween costume is hard?

It wasn’t, at least, for Today’s Savannah Guthrie as she sported a spot-on recreation of Reese Witherspoon’s Elle Woods from Legally Blonde. The iconic costume was complete with a realistic blonde wig, a leather pink skirt and jacket set, a stuffed pooch Bruiser and—best of all—an appearance from Luke Wilson.

Luke, of course, played Elle’s love interest Emmett Richmond in the film—the dedicated teaching assistant Elle ultimately marries in the sequel Legally Blonde 2: Red, White & Blonde.

For the special Today appearance, Luke was seen walking arm-in-arm with Savannah as Elle. And he even dressed the part wearing a classic Emmett-inspired navy suit with a red and gray tie. The duo exchanged a friendly hug and high five after sporting their show-stopping look for the audience in the Today plaza.

Meanwhile, the other Today cohosts didn’t hold back on their festive outfits. Hoda Kotb and Jenna Bush Hager rocked a joint costume as well, dressing up as Titanic’s Jack and Rose. Carson Daly and Sheinelle Jones also teamed up—dressing as Austin Powers and Foxxy Cleopatra from the 1997 film."

1031,2024-10-31 14:25:23,"This Halloween, What Are New Jersey Voters Really",https://www.newswise.com/articles/this-halloween-what-are-new-jersey-voters-really-afraid-of-more-than-half-say-the-2024-election/?sc=rsln,Entertainment,"When asked how the upcoming 2024 presidential election makes them feel, a majority of New Jersey voters express some kind of dread, according to the latest Rutgers-Eagleton Poll.

Fifty-seven percent say something about being anxious (15%), nervous (14%), uneasy (12%), scared (12%) or worried (4%). Eight percent cite being excited, optimistic or hopeful. Another 4% are stressed, and 3% say the election is making them physically ill. Two percent say they feel disappointed and another 2% say they are confused or uncertain.

“Every four years, the end of ‘spooky season’ not only brings Halloween but also the final stretch of the presidential election and the possibility of an October surprise,” said Ashley Koning, an assistant research professor and director of the Eagleton Center for Public Interest Polling (ECPIP) at Rutgers University-New Brunswick. “Perhaps what’s not a surprise this election cycle, however, is just how tense Garden State voters are feeling about this nail-biter of a presidential race, with almost 9 in 10 mentioning some type of negative feeling.”

When asked how often they feel certain emotions because of politics these days, voters in the Garden State are more negative than positive. Forty percent say they “never” feel proud, 40% feel proud “some of the time,” 11% “about half of the time,” 5% “most of the time” and 2% “always.” Likewise, 38% say they are “never” enthusiastic, 36% are enthusiastic “some of the time,” 14% “about half of the time,” 7% “most of the time” and 2% “always.”

On the other hand, 32% of voters are “always” worried about politics these days and another 35% are worried “most of the time”; 13% say they are worried “about half of the time,” 16% “some of the time” and 3% “never.”

Voters express more variance when it comes to feelings of anger: 12% are “always” angry, 29% are angry “most of the time,” 21% “about half of the time” and 29% “some of the time.” Nine percent say they are “never” angry.

“Independents – a crucial voting bloc in any election – say they are less often proud and less often enthusiastic about politics these days than their partisan counterparts,” said Jessica Roman, director of data management and analysis at ECPIP. “Yet independents and partisans alike say they are about equally angry almost all the time and, even more so, are almost always worried. Negative emotions are prevalent in politics, but candidates need to be careful that these feelings spur more action than inaction come Election Day.”

When it comes to the personal qualities of the two presidential candidates, voters are more likely to associate “extreme,” “incompetent,” and “emotional” with Republican nominee and former President Donald Trump, while they associate “empathetic” and “trustworthy” with Democratic nominee and current Vice President Kamala Harris. Residents are more split on which candidate they associate with patriotism and strength.

Voters are more than three times as likely to characterize Trump as more “extreme” than Harris – 61% to 18%; 12% say it describes both candidates equally and 5% say it describes neither. Independents are about 2.5 times as likely to attribute this to Trump than Harris, as are nearly 9 in 10 Democrats; even Republicans are split on this trait: 35% assign it to Trump, 33% assign it to Harris and 22% ascribe it to both.

About half of voters associate incompetence with Trump (52%), 32% say it describes Harris better, 9% associate incompetence with both candidates equally and 4% don’t ascribe this trait to either candidate. Independents are somewhat split (42% Trump versus 36% Harris), while 88% of Democrats and 73% of Republicans ascribe it to their party’s opponent.

Voters characterize Harris as more “empathetic” than Trump by a 34-point margin – 53% to 19%. Two percent associate this trait with both candidates and 20% say they don’t associate it with either candidate. Independent voters are three times more likely to say this trait describes Harris better and 31% say neither candidate, while 87% of Democrats say it describes Harris better; 51% of Republicans associate “empathetic” with Trump.

Forty-two percent of voters associate being “trustworthy” with Harris, 24% associate it with Trump, 2% say both equally and 25% say neither. Most independent voters say the trait describes neither candidate, while 27% say Harris and 22% say Trump. Democrats are more likely than Republicans to associate the trait with their respective candidate.

Thirty-six percent of voters associate being “emotional” with Trump, while 23% associate this trait with Harris. Ten percent say they associate being emotional with both candidates and 20% say they don’t associate it with either candidate. Partisans of all stripes are more mixed on this trait than any other, with independents and especially Democrats giving an edge to Trump and Republicans being more split.

Voters are split when it comes to patriotism. Forty percent associate being “patriotic” with Trump, while 37% associate it with Harris; 9% say it describes both equally and 9% ascribe it to neither candidate. Independents give Trump an advantage on this trait (48% versus 23% Harris), while 7 in 10 Democrats and about 8 in 10 Republicans ascribe it to their candidate.

“Patriotism has become a charged concept this election cycle, and the two presidential campaigns are now fighting over who ‘owns’ it,” Koning said. “While Republicans have typically made patriotism their own in recent history, the Harris campaign has strived to rebrand patriotism into a Democratic Party value that disentangles it from the more nationalistic version touted by the opposing side.”

Voters are most split, though, when it comes to strength. Forty percent of voters say “strong” better describes Harris and another 40% say it better describes Trump; 7% say both equally and 10% say neither candidate. Independents give an edge to Trump on this trait (45% to 26%), while three-quarters or more of Democrats and Republicans alike attribute it to their respective candidate.

“Female candidates have traditionally been confronted by the perception that they lack the competence and strength required in politics, while trying to balance empathy and often being seen as too emotional – standards that few male candidates are held to,” said Debra Borie-Holtz, senior survey scholar at ECPIP. “These perceptions are turned on their heads a bit in New Jersey, with Harris holding her own when it comes to these more traditionally masculine leadership qualities and Trump being ascribed what have historically been viewed as more negative, feminine traits.”

Results are from a statewide poll of 1,018 adults contacted through the probability-based Rutgers-Eagleton/SSRS Garden State Panel from Oct. 15 to Oct. 22. The full sample has a margin of error of +/- 4.1 percentage points. The registered voter subsample contains 929 registered voters and has a margin of error of +/- 4.2 percentage points."
1031,2024-10-31 14:25:16,Worst player roles in Football Manager,https://www.videogamer.com/features/football-manager-worst-player-roles/,Entertainment,"You can trust VideoGamer.

Some of these roles are on their way out in Football Manager 2025, and, let’s be honest, most of us won’t miss them. Yet, they’ve been around long enough to earn a place in FM history as the ‘worst’ roles – partly ineffective, partly iconic. Before they’re gone for good, let’s give them a farewell.

Enganche

Maybe it’s just my tactics, but the Enganche has never quite clicked. FM describes it as a “more stationary” role, which makes me picture someone who literally doesn’t move all game—a passenger in every sense of the word. It’s the role I stick my 33-year-old playmaker in when his acceleration drops to single digits. In real life, we’ve seen the death of playmakers like Ozil and James Rodriguez, and the Enganche feels like a luxury player’s last stand. With everyone gegenpressing around them, they’re basically fossils on the pitch.

Trequartista

The Trequartista suffers the same problem. FM practically admits it’s a “defensive liability,” saying, “the rest of the team needs to carry him when defending.” We’re in 2024; even Kylian Mbappe tracks back these days (unless you’re PSG and happen to have Lionel Messi). This would be okay if the Trequartista was jaw-dropping in attack, but spoiler alert: they aren’t. Running a Trequartista is practically begging for a 6.3 rating, whether you play them up top, on the wing, or as an AM.

False nine

False Nines are as tricky in FM as they are in real life. The role’s so specialist that only the best can make it look good—think Harry Kane, Messi, or the golden unicorn of League Two. Try it with anyone else, and you’re risking a tactical disaster (as Lee Carsley recently found out with England). If you don’t have a top-tier player or the luxury of experimentation, you’ll want to give this one a wide berth. It could be amazing if it worked, but the chances are just too slim.

Carrilero

Let’s be real, the Carrilero is the FM role equivalent of getting a meal deal with ready salted chips, a ham sandwich, and a bottle of water. It’s functional, it’s reliable, but it’s not exactly thrilling. No one’s winning Man of the Match as a Carrilero in a Champions League final. With exciting roles like the Mezzala and Half Back around, the Carrilero just feels a bit… beige.

Regista

This might sound boomer-ish, but a defensive midfielder who doesn’t tackle and focuses on “creativity”? Come on. When I think of the guy sitting behind my midfield, I picture someone “carrying the boats,” doing the gritty work so the creative players don’t have to. Using a Regista in FM feels like watching a counter-attack sail past your defensive midfielder who’s too busy “being creative.” Unless you’re Manchester City or have a Pirlo regen, do the classic Brexit move and bring in a proper Ball Winner or Half Back.

There is going to be a lot of disagreement with my choices, so let me know which ones you’d change in the comment section. Have you managed to make any of these work effectively?

The event went down Wednesday night ... and, like we told you, it received some side-eye from the right when President Joe Biden leaned in and pretended to take a bite out of a baby's leg. The kid was dressed as a chicken, to be fair -- but, that did little to slow the spread of the image on social media.

Turns out this wasn't the only time JB was feeling famished ... pretending to bite the foot of a different kiddo and kissing a couple other babies on the cheeks.

It's all clearly in good fun -- and, far from the only sweet interaction the 81-year-old prez had with dressed-up kids.

Biden showed his support for the Air Force ... standing at attention and giving a salute to one of the children dressed as a member of the U.S. armed forces.

Biggest takeaway here ... Joe seems to love the Halloween season -- looking totally floored by many of the trick-or-treaters in their costumes who came up to his front door for a few pieces of candy."

Note: This is a double recap of the final two episodes of Agatha All Along, which both dropped on October 30 as two halves of a greater whole. Spoilers ahead, etc.!

You know how some people walked out of the Barbie movie going, “How the hell did they get away with that?” I didn’t, but that’s how I feel about Agatha All Along, which I can now officially say has surprised the hell out of me.

I’m not sure what I was expecting from this show — no, actually, that’s a lie. I know exactly what I thought we’d be getting from Agatha All Along: a solid TV series starring some of the greats, with a couple fun twists that nonetheless would eventually give way to a CGI fight and typical tie-in to the greater Marvel universe. I figured it would have flair and trusted Kathryn Hahn in particular to imbue her character with the pathos Elizabeth Olsen found in Wanda before her. And, sure, we got all that. But we also got a surprisingly bold and astonishingly self-assured piece of TV work that managed to avoid the usual Marvel pitfalls — endless blue-screen sky fights, Ouroboros references to Avengers lore, any single agent of S.H.I.E.L.D., et cetera — to become something all its own.

For as much as I enjoyed WandaVision, I found myself agreeing with Agatha realizing that Billy himself is responsible for conjuring up the Road(!). Unlike Marvel Phase Whatever, and in an even more distinct way than WandaVision, Jac Schaeffer’s Agatha All Along managed to do something interesting with its power. Fueled by a combination of grief, curiosity, and determination, Billy did indeed take after his birth mother to create something both fantastical and very real in terms of its consequences. It wasn’t Agatha, legendary serial scammer, but Billy all along. WandaVision’s similar reveals got rushed and confused once the show had to bring in the movies, but Agatha doesn’t have that issue. Absent the need to immediately tie into the greater Marvel plan, the Billy reveal(s) got to take their time, and become even more powerful for it.

“Follow Me, My Friend, to Glory at the End” picks up seconds after “I Hold Death’s Hand in Mine” left off, but instead of living in the glorious slo-mo tumble of Lilia’s sacrifice, we’re now faced with the cold, hard reality of her death. Jen beats at the door Lilia closed in her face and collapses, more exhausted and furious and distraught than we’ve ever seen her. Even Agatha seems more shaken by this death than the one she more directly caused (once again: RIP, Alice, whom we see walk off with Rio into the afterlife even though she says, through tears, that she was nowhere near ready to go). Hahn shifts into yet another gear in these moments, her raw desperation in these quieter moments contrasting sharply with the brash theatricality she puts on whenever anyone else is around — anyone, that is, except her ex.

Now that Rio’s true identity as Lady Death is out in the open, playtime appears to be over. Also, realizing who Teen actually is has royally pissed her off. “He’s an abomination,” she says of Billy/William. “He is disrupting the sacred balance! … what he wants from the Road is a violation.” Harsh, but you know what? Also fair! Wanda created a family out of thin air, and now one of her kids is living in another one’s body, with his twin potentially doing the same. If you’re Death, whose entire point of existence is to make sure the dead stay that way, this kind of workaround is gonna pose a problem, to say the least. Rio sees him as a thief, but apparently he’s one that can’t be caught; instead, he has to turn himself in.

Agatha, ever in search of ways to stay alive, promises to deliver Billy at the Road’s end if Rio will stop stalking her every move. “When I die, a long, long, long, long, time from now,” she continues, “I don’t want to see your face.” Rio’s stung, but if she knows Agatha as well as it seems, she shouldn’t believe her. Agatha and Death are so perversely fascinated by and so magnetically attracted to each other, despite it all, that there’s no fuckin’ way Agatha would want to go out without getting off one last time.

With Lilia’s death fracturing the coven even deeper, whatever structure the Road had before starts to collapse. Trying to walk to the next Earth trial without their Green Witch brings them right back to the shoes they abandoned at the start, and the sight of the three pairs that will never see their owners again erodes whatever patience Billy had left. “Screw the Road,” he snarls, shoving his foot back into his boot. Next thing he knows, he’s waking up in a body bag alongside Agatha and Jen in a stark, white room for (they hope) one last trial.

Whatever it is, it gives both Sasheer Zamata and Jen Kale the showcase they deserve. When Jen realizes that it was actually hired mercenary Agatha who bound her magic, she releases a century’s worth of pent-up … well, everything. She looks Agatha and her own self-doubt in the eye, invokes a spell-breaking incantation, and reclaims her magic for herself, before getting zapped out of the Road and into the clear pink skies above. Zamata is so, so good in this episode as she shows off the full range of what she can do, and if Jen should return in future, the MCU would be very lucky to have her.

Once Jen is gone and Agatha’s faced with the reality of possibly handing Billy over to Rio, the Road and series alike rapidly unravel — which makes it sounds like they lose control, but that’s not the case at all. In fact, the end of the Road for this “coven of two” is only the beginning. As ever, this show’s really packed a ton of story into impressively short episode run times. (Stranger Things, I am absolutely begging you to take notes!)

After Jen’s left the Road with her prize of power, Billy and Agatha are left to puzzle out their own escape hatches. Though Agatha promised Rio she’d get Billy to hand himself over, she instead basically sits him down for an intensive meditation class with the goal of locating Tommy’s far-flung soul. As the eerie ceiling lights start to flicker out, Agatha guides Billy through aural flashbacks of his final moments in Westview, a.k.a. those final blow moments of WandaVision. He can’t quite remember his twin, but he can feel him like a second heartbeat, like “that feeling when your body knows it’s safe.” That feeling doesn’t last long, though, because soon enough he’s following Tommy’s spirit to a backyard pool outside Wanda’s Westview Hex, where some teens prank their friend into an accidental drowning. Wherever that body is seems to be his best bet to find Tommy. With that revelation, Billy gets zapped out of the Road, too.

Which leaves only Agatha, who’s used to being alone, but isn’t thrilled about it in this case. Not even trying to plant a lock of her son’s hair in a floor crack, with her own tears to boot, seems to do the trick; the walls cave in and she only barely gets away. She bangs and bangs on a door to get let out, but when it finally gives way, she doesn’t have time to be relieved. The vibe outside the Road is giving “a sepia-toned tornado is on its way to fuck your shit right up” — but in this case, of course, that tornado is Death herself.

This is the point where I got nervous that we were about to get some mind-numbingly bland, CG’ed magic battle. (Let’s just say I watched Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Whatever this weekend and leave it at that.) But Agatha and Rio’s final clash isn’t just operatic, but viscerally bloody. Aubrey Plaza’s made no secret of loving this role, and how could she not with scenes like this, which let her openly cackle and snarl and slice? Agatha’s right that they “can’t fight Death” forever, but man, is it fun to watch them try.

This sequence also has the grounding force of Billy, now decked out in full Wiccan garb, at the height of his powers even after donating some to Agatha — who, in an extremely uncharacteristic act, manages to stop herself before sucking every ounce of it out of his body. Good job, Agatha! But wait, there’s more: The second Billy offers himself up to Rio, she seizes the chance to bounce. Bad job, Agatha!! Billy, who’s rapidly become powerful on a level that must really annoy Agatha, then gets inside her head to ask the one question she never wants to answer: “Is this how your son died?”

It’s hard to know exactly what goes through Agatha’s mind at this, but it’s safe to say plenty of it is tinged with regret. And so she turns on her heel and grabs Death in an impassioned kiss, letting someone else suck the life out of her, for once. Once again, I must point out how extremely gay this entire situation is. Death by making out with your ex-girlfriend, who’s literally Death?! Rio was right; no one in history has had “special treatment” quite like Agatha Harkness.

With the rapid decaying of Agatha’s body into the ground, the original Green Witch’s work is done, and so she takes her reluctant leave. Billy does the same, though the slo-mo solemnity of his exit from Westview loses some of its gravitas when he and his superhero cloak have to drive his Subaru home. It’s only once he’s back in his very cool, densely decorated bedroom that he realizes what actually just happened.

Agatha didn’t lie when she told him the Road wasn’t real; no one was more surprised than her when a door appeared in the floor to send them on their way. Billy just wanted to believe in its magic so badly that he made it happen, drawing inspiration from his own life and reference points to create every trial and bump they encountered along the Road. Credit where it’s due to the production and set-design teams, which I already said killed it with William/Billy’s room, but I didn’t realize how much they killed it — they gave us all the clues! (Extra credit for the unmistakable “Trans Lives Matter” flag, too.)

Though he and Agatha’s ghost end up having unfinished business (“it’s not loyalty — it’s analysis”), it would’ve been so easy to end the season there. But what makes this show so intriguing is that it once again zigs where we expect it to zag. After seemingly bringing the story to a fitting close with Wiccan’s origin story, the final episode — “Mother, Maiden, Crone” — throws us all the way back to 1750 Salem for Agatha’s. It’s to director Gandja Monteiro’s credit that she took on this episode as well as the previous one; they couldn’t be more different in visual scope, with one bouncing between a stark white room and Westview, and the other mostly in 18th-century forests. Still, she handles both with a deft eye for what each scene can say about the characters at their heart.

In “Maiden, Mother, Crone,” we see Agatha at each of these life stages. We see her attempt to give birth only to get interrupted by her “love,” Death, and beg for more time. We see Death grant it, but only for so long. We see Agatha and her son, Nicky, form a mother-son scammer team that lures unsuspecting witches into giving up their lives and power to bolster hers. We see them make up a silly song to entertain them throughout their travels — and it sounds all too familiar, since we’ve already heard “The Ballad” about a dozen times before. We see why she gained such a reputation as a serial “witch killer” (because it was, uh, entirely accurate), but also what she lost when Nicky finally had to follow Rio into the dark.

After Nicky’s death left her without a purpose beyond her own power grabs, she spent the next hundreds of years running a different, solo scam: the Road. She’d tell witches she could bring them to it and then, when singing “The Ballad” didn’t work, absorb all their powers for herself to maintain her status as the Road’s “sole survivor.” That Agatha’s con took advantage of so many people for so long is a wrenching twist (if a little funny to realize that the great Agatha Harkness was essentially just a pioneer of the MLM movement). It’s also a twist the show’s earned by demonstrating time and time again what’s always made her tick.

After the first episode of this show, I wondered if the Agatha team would have the guts to tell the story of a villain without ultimately redeeming her into a fallen hero. After the last one, I was thrilled to see them rise to the challenge. Agatha’s complicated, crafty, and certainly capable of love. She was neglected and traumatized by those closest to her, and lost every piece of family she ever had. She’s also incredibly self-serving to the point that she was, once again, a ruthless serial killer who preyed on anyone who showed her even a scrap of vulnerability. She was not a good person, but she is a great character, and it’s been a real treat to watch her story from middle, to end, to beginning, and back again.

The Snarkhold-overs:

• If I were able to separately rate these episodes, “Follow Me, My Friend” would probably get four and “Maiden, Mother, Crone” five for sticking the landing, which averages out to 4.5, so why not round up?

• Well done to anyone who figured out the ultimate twist of the Road being all Billy’s doing, especially those who clocked the blue magic surrounding the door! I don’t always love it when a show does a flashback montage of all the clues we missed, but this one was a lot of fun.

• One last Kathryn Hahn Line Read of the Week: I usually go with something snappy and fun, but this time, I’m giving it to her heartbroken “Sometimes, boys die.” A world of pain in one phrase that requires an actor like Hahn to land it right.

• Ah what the hell, an Aubrey Plaza Line Read of the Week for the Road: “I am the natural order of all things, baby. And you love me!”

Absolutely loved Rio leaving the Road by simply ……… taking her dagger to the canvas scenery. Not just another hint that the whole Road sprung up out of whole cloth, but a sly practical effect, too.

• Credit to Joe Locke for handling a very tricky role and, not for nothing, reminding me that Billy’s not just Wanda’s kid, but Vision’s.

• Highly recommend checking out the Instagram of Daniel Selon, Agatha’s lead costume designer, for in-depth BTS insight on how all the looks came together. I can’t wait to hear more about the different eras of Agatha’s Road scam, most especially her ’90s Craft look.

• If you’ve gotten this far, whew! What a journey we’ve all been on. Thank you for reading these recaps, it really has been a blast (so to speak). If (Ghost!) Agatha and Billy do go on an unlikely adventure to find Tommy and we get to see it, I’m all in.

Come see Agatha’s best frenemy Wanda at Vulture Festival, November 16–17 in Los Angeles, where we’ll be talking to Elizabeth Olsen.

Earlier this month, attorney Tony Buzbee announced that he'd be representing 120 individuals planning to take legal action against Diddy. One of these individuals, who chose to remain anonymous, accuses the Bad Boy founder of sexually assaulting her in 2004. Now, however, Judge Mary Kay Vyskocil has ruled that the accuser has not proven she's entitled to remain anonymous.

According to TMZ, she describes Jane Doe as an adult who ""decided to file a lawsuit in which she accuses a famous person of engaging in heinous conduct approximately 20 years ago."" As a result, she must file a complaint under her name by November 13. If she doesn't, the case will reportedly be thrown out.

Shortly after Buzbee's aforementioned press conference, Diddy's legal team released a statement on his behalf. “As Mr. Combs’ legal team has emphasized, he cannot address every meritless allegation in what has become a reckless media circus,"" one of his lawyers, Erica Wolff, told Rolling Stone. ""That said, Mr. Combs emphatically and categorically denies as false and defamatory any claim that he sexually abused anyone, including minors. He looks forward to proving his innocence and vindicating himself in court if and when claims are filed and served, where the truth will be established based on evidence, not speculation."""

1031,2024-10-31 14:24:38,"""It Looks Like A VaR Shock To Me"": Gilts, Pound Crash Amid Panic Over Unsustainable UK Deficit",https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/it-looks-var-shock-me-gilts-pound-crash-amid-panic-over-unsustainable-uk-deficit,Business,"As we warned yesterday in our review of the just announced UK Budget (see ""UK Gilt Yields Soar After Reeves Reveals Budget: Market Braces For Inflationary Debt Surge""), debt has always been the UK’s Achilles’ heel. That's because ""while the US has the world’s reserve currency, the UK doesn’t have that privilege, only an ability to print as much of a currency that fewer and fewer people want. That’s potentially very inflationary in the longer term, and that's precisely why the market is reacting the way it is.""

Our bottom line was that with markets once again waking up to the likelihood that rates in the UK aren’t likely to fall as much previously expected, or the BOE would want, and should the blow out in yields continue, we may be just days away from another emergency QE action by the BOE in the past two years as the world is reminded that the only reason why the US can and continues to borrow like a drunken sailor, is because it still has the world's reserve currency, although judging by the explosion in gold and bitcoin in recent days, that won't last long.

This morning we are getting confirmation that we may have been right once more, because both 2Y and 10Y Gilt yields are blowing out, and trading literally on top of each other as the entire gilt curve pancakes. The 10Y is trading at the highest level since Oct 2023, while the 2Y is back to May levels.

The sudden blowout is not just confined to gilts however: as UBS trader Leo He notes, as the UK 2y yield is spiking, GBPUSD is selling off sharply.

""It looks like a VaR shock to me"", He warns, and adds that ""the US 2y yield is following the sharp rise in the UK 2 yield.""

No wonder why we used a lettuce for teaser image for our budget review post.

Commenting on the huger move in gilts, DB's Jim Reid agrees with our take and writes this morning that ""the main catalyst was that markets realized the true scale of the fiscal easing, as the UK Debt Management Office’s (DMO) revised gross financing needs were twice (c.£146bn) what DB expected between 2025-2029.""

As DB's economist Sanjay Raja noted in his review here, “today’s budget marks one of the largest fiscal loosening of any fiscal event in decades”.

Surprising it took the market one full day to figure it out.

Anyeay, the chart below from DB's Sanjay shows that the only bigger fiscal loosening in the last decade-and-a-half was the pandemic easing.

As Reid notes, it is interesting that 10yr Gilts are now only 10bps lower than the closing peak two business days after the ill-fated ""mini-budget"" under PM Liz Truss back in September 2022. On the day of that budget, they climbed around 42bps and then 26bps the following day. In terms of comparing the two budgets, in 2022 there were £45bn of unfunded tax giveaways, whereas yesterday’s had £32bn of unfunded commitments. One could argue the credibility of yesterday’s is enhanced by around 1/3rd of increased government spending being targeted for investment in the economy rather than the tax cuts of two years ago.

As Reid further reminds us, the Truss mini-budget would have been a complete reversal of economic policy in the UK, with a massive package of tax cuts, just as the Fed was still raising rates by 75bps while inflation remained high. They'd also just announced a significant energy price guarantee a couple of weeks earlier. So it was fuel to a fire, and then the LDI pension crisis occurred and the Bank of England intervened, with Truss standing down as PM shortly after.

The market reaction to yesterday’s budget probably wasn’t helped by strong European data pushing up yields on the continent and with general upward pressure on US yields as Trump looks to have generally improved his standing in the polls in recent weeks.

Still, let's put this all in perspective: the UK budget deficit between 2025 and 2029 is expected to average around 2.5% of GDP. In the US, it could be 7-9% without offsetting measures to the campaign promises of the two candidates. This, Reid echoes our note from yesterday, ""helps highlight the exorbitant privilege of the US in having the world's reserve currency.""

After all, other countries with smaller deficits are starting to hit debt and deficit levels where markets are now raising their eyebrows (and term premia) as a minimum and concern (in the case of 2022) at the extremes. The continuing French budget issues are another example of this.

So in conclusion, yesterday’s budget was probably two-thirds of the Truss mini-budget, in terms of a fiscal easing but rather than biased towards tax cuts the bulk of the higher borrowing is due to a lot more investment, albeit ones that aren’t expected to bear fruit in growth terms until after the 5yr time horizon. In the meantime, however, debt will rise higher... much higher, and that's what the market is realizing today."

As one of only 20 LEED-certified buildings in Latvia, the data center will set new standards for green construction and energy efficiency in the Baltic region. The project is planned to be launched in August 2025.

With over €30 million invested, the carrier-neutral 10 MW data center will offer a full range of IT and network solutions and house up to 1,000 racks. The 6,000-square-meter facility is designed for scalability, with potential expansion up to 30 MW, making it ideal for hyperscalers, AI, and high-power computing needs.

The new data center reached its highest point, and the topping-out ceremony was well attended by the Latvian Speaker of the Parliament Daiga Mierina, the Minister of Climate and Energy Kaspars Melnis, the Minister of Smart Administration and Regional Development Inga Berzina, as well as Member of the Riga City Council and leaders of associations. They highlighted the project as a great example of sustainable business planning, its importance for the growth of the Latvian economy, the IT industry's export potential, and global competitiveness.

Due to Delska's goal of achieving net zero CO2 by 2030, the data center will be entirely powered by green energy and rely on backup generators using Neste MY diesel, produced from renewables. Additionally, the facility will be equipped with an energy-efficient and innovative Vindur® CoolW@ll cooling system. The data center will operate at a power usage effectiveness (PUE) under 1.3.

""With the establishment of this data center, we are fully prepared to deliver the required space and power capacity, especially when power-demanding AI tools have seen a significant increase and Europe is lacking required power and data center capacity,"" explains Andris Gailitis, the CEO of Delska.

The growing demand for Internet of Things solutions, digital transformation, and cloud services drives data consumption like never before. Smart homes, video streaming platforms, and artificial intelligence tools rely on data centers' ability to deliver content to users worldwide without delay. Companies want to expand their operations without significant investments in maintaining their IT infrastructure.

Delska plans to build another data center in Lithuania and expand its group of companies to create a comprehensive regional data center and network ecosystem.

1031,2024-10-31 14:20:30,Trump Vs. Harris: Who Are Whales Betting On And Who's The Favorite Of Smaller Bettors?,https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/10/41655616/trump-vs-harris-who-are-whales-betting-on-and-whos-the-favorite-of-smaller-bettors,Top,"In the race for the U.S. presidency, a stark contrast emerges on Polymarket as the distribution of Donald Trump and Kamala Harris shares highlights distinct economic philosophies that mirror each candidate's policies.

What Happened: According to data from Primo Data and Polymarketanalytics, the ownership concentration reveals two markedly different supporter profiles, with Trump's largest backers consolidating a majority of the shares, while Kamala's supporters appear more diverse and evenly distributed.

Trump's ""Yes"" shares on Polymarket show that five major accounts hold 50% of the total 162 million shares—an estimated $81 million in payouts should he win.

The largest of these accounts, dubbed ""Le Giga Whale,"" holds nearly a third of these shares alone, underscoring a heavily concentrated backing that mirrors Trump's strong appeal to high-net-worth investors and large stakeholders.

Conversely, Kamala's ""Yes"" shares tell a different story.

The top five holders account for only 18% of shares, with no individual holding exceeding 5%.

This broad ownership reflects a decentralized base, aligning with her policy stance focused on appealing to a broader cross-section of the population.

The divide becomes even more apparent when considering the popular vote on Polymarket. Trump's top backers—led once again by ""Monsieur Whale""—command 82% of ""Yes"" shares, setting the stage for a potential $36 million payout if he secures the popular vote.

Kamala's top five backers, by contrast, hold only 25% of the vote's total shares. Notably, Polymarket's biggest all-time loser, ""therealbatman,"" has taken the top spot among those betting on Kamala for the popular vote.

What’s Next: As the election approaches, market watchers will have a closer look at the Benzinga Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19, where industry experts will discuss the evolving landscape of digital assets and prediction markets in politics.

DOWNINGTOWN, PA — As part of its unwavering dedication to promoting diversity and inclusivity, the Downingtown Area School District (DASD) has initiated its annual observance of Indian Heritage Month and Native American Heritage Month. These celebrations, which began on October 25 at Bradford Heights Elementary School, are set to continue across the district throughout November.

While Indian Heritage Month lacks federal recognition, DASD emphasizes its importance by acknowledging the achievements and contributions of South Asians both in the United States and globally. This recognition is particularly significant given that the Asian community constitutes the largest minority group within the district, with Upper Uwchlan Township being home to one of Pennsylvania’s most substantial Asian populations.

Justin Brown, the district’s Director of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, highlighted the vital role of acknowledging the contributions of South Asians in American history. He remarked, “It’s always important to recognize the often-overlooked achievements of South Asians in every field throughout our nation’s past.” This statement underscores DASD’s commitment to fostering an understanding and appreciation of diverse cultural histories within its educational framework.

Throughout November, DASD schools have organized a series of activities designed to engage students, parents, and community members in celebrating Indian and Native American cultures. These events offer opportunities to explore and appreciate cultural heritage through music, cuisine, and traditional customs, thereby enriching the community’s cultural understanding and unity.

By celebrating these heritage months, DASD not only honors the diverse backgrounds of its students and families but also reinforces its commitment to inclusivity and cultural appreciation. These efforts reflect the district’s broader mission to create an educational environment where diversity is celebrated and every student feels valued and represented.

“Presidential endorsements do nothing to tip the scales of an election,” Bezos wrote. “What presidential endorsements really do is create a notion of bias. A notion of non-independence.”

Submit CEO Will Lewis introduced in a memo on Thursday that the paper wouldn’t endorse a candidate for president — the primary time since 1988 — and can stop to take action for future elections. The information got here three days after the Los Angeles Instances introduced related plans.

In his editorial on Monday, Bezos wrote that their determination was one solution to rebuild the general public’s belief, he mentioned had been degraded by “off-the-cuff podcasts, inaccurate social media posts and different unverified information sources.” He additionally referenced a Gallup ballot reporting that People’ belief within the media had fallen under that of Congress.

1029,2024-10-29 08:30:00,Casler: Why drinking more water really is that good for you,https://auburnpub.com/life-entertainment/water-health-benefit/article_51b0211c-953a-11ef-947f-b7cc2dea6325.html,Entertainment,"Even if you don’t make a habit of keeping up on wellness trends, it is common knowledge that we should all be drinking more water and staying hydrated. ""Drink more water"" is the most blanket piece of wellness advice no matter what the ailment is. But have you ever stopped and wondered what ingesting this miracle liquid does for your body and brain? Drinking water goes beyond warding off drymouth and keeping your whistle wet (in fact, if you have drymouth, you’re already past the point of dehydration). Drinking adequate amounts of water improves skin, brain function, digestion and sleep. Here are some ways that drinking H2O improves performance and helps us function at our best!

Waste removal. An important role that water has in the body is removing toxins through functions such as urination and perspiration. Have you ever been next to a person on the treadmill that smells like they went to margarita Tuesday the previous night? That’s because they are sweating out toxins such as alcohol through perspiration. Being hydrated enough to urinate often is also important for flushing our body's system to rid itself of toxins found in our foods, products we use and the environment.

Weight management. Drinking adequate amounts of water helps to maintain hunger cues and allows the body to notice the difference between hunger and thirst (the two can often mirror one another). Drinking at least 8 ounces of water every hour can help identify when we do need to eat, or if we are simply low on hydration. Drinking water throughout the day also helps regulate blood sugar levels.

Glowing skin. Have you ever gone away for a long weekend, only to come back and have your once beautiful, vibrant flowers, looking shriveled and sad? They are dehydrated! Much like our house plants, our skin tends to get wilted and dry-looking when we need water. You will notice a big difference in the brightness of your eyes and the plumpness of your face when you start to hydrate yourself. Drinking water also helps reduce inflammation in our face that leads to acne and blemishes.

Mental performance. Every chemical reaction in the body requires the presence of water. This is especially true for the processes in our brain. In the afternoon, when our brain functions start to slow, many of us reach for caffeine to avoid the afternoon slump. We should instead be reaching for water, especially if it contains electrolytes. Water is a simple and often free way to boost our clarity, memory and decision-making.

Physical output. You cannot expect much power output from a river that has run dry! Our bodies need water to perform the most basic physical tasks, but also to achieve fitness goals. You will never be able to perform at your peak if you are not properly hydrated. Proper hydration increases nutrient and oxygen delivery to working muscles, and ensures every organ system in your body works properly. Athletes who are dehydrated often feel sluggish and nauseous, get headaches easily, and feel like their body’s battery is on zero. To increase physical output or just keep up with the physical demands of daily life, staying hydrated should be at the top of your to-do list.

Can achieving glowing skin, improved memory, and increased physical performance really be as simple as drinking more water? The answer is yes! The secret to wellness is found right in your kitchen sink, is most likely free and is readily available for you. If that sounds too good to be true, just remember that some of the most basic health and wellness protocols don’t need to cost a fortune. Fresh air, water, walking and sleeping are all free and don’t need an Instagram shop to advertise them!

Water is the liquid of life, as boring as that might sound. If you don’t like the taste of plain water (many people don’t) lucky for you, there are numerous types of flavored water you can find at your local grocery store. If you are a flavored water fan, try to steer away from any water that has unnatural flavors or sugars added. The closer to natural, the better.

Drink your way to a smaller waistline, more productive working hours and better digestion simply by turning on your tap. Water is essential to life, essential to health and essential to functioning at our highest potential."

When it comes to relationships, some say that age is just a number. But for others, dating those who are significantly older or younger can pose problems. It may feel harder to relate to them if they're from a different generation, after all. Those in age gap partnerships can also face the judgement of others. This can be a big fear – as shown by a teenager who took to Reddit to ask for advice on dating a man 27-years his senior. The 19-year-old, who is with a 46-year-old, revealed he'd been talking to his mom about his boyfriend without including many details. He explained: ""I was recently talking to my mom about what me and him got up to last weekend and she was interested in meeting him.""

Trending

The anonymous teen continued: ""I have no problem with this he's an incredibly sweet and funny man and I'm really happy in my relationship with him the only potential problem is that. She doesn't know that we have a large age gap and I'm worried that this will make her uncomfortable as he is older than she is."" He worries his mom will ""write him off as a creep"" without getting to know him due to his age. Seeking advice, he added: ""If she got to know him I think they would really get on, they have the same sort of dry humor. So I just wanted to know that if your son brought home someone older than you how would you react? Any help I would really appreciate it."" The post didn't get a positive reaction from everyone – as some were concerned by the age gap. They even went as far as branding the older man a ""creep""."

SBUX, with its low-cost beverages. This move follows a fraud scandal that led to Luckin’s delisting from Nasdaq and a hefty fine.

What Happened: Luckin Coffee, which became China’s biggest coffee chain during the COVID-19 pandemic, is now looking to make a mark in the U.S. The company, which was delisted from Nasdaq and fined $180 million due to a fraud scandal, is planning to launch in the U.S. as early as next year, reported the Financial Times, citing two people familiar with the matter.

Luckin, which opened its 20,000th store in China in July, plans to target cities with large numbers of Chinese students and tourists, such as New York. The company has been running advertisements during NBA games to build name recognition ahead of its planned launch.

Luckin aims to leverage its experience selling affordable coffee in China and undercut U.S. incumbents by selling drinks priced around $2 or $3. The company is also preparing for an expansion in Southeast Asia.

Luckin Coffee did not immediately respond to Benzinga's request for comment.

Why It Matters: The company, once considered China’s answer to Starbucks, has not only survived but also emerged as a fierce competitor to the Seattle-based coffee giant. Luckin Coffee’s low-cost lattes have attracted a growing customer base, propelling it to become China’s largest coffee retailer, surpassing Starbucks.

Starbucks, on the other hand, has been facing challenges in China, including competition from local brands like Luckin Coffee and Manner Coffee. The Seattle-based retailer’s recent moves in China, such as a significant increase in discounting strategies, have raised concerns about its long-term strategy and market position in China.

Starbucks’ former CEO, Howard Schultz, reportedly urged the coffee chain to acknowledge its faults and revamp operations following a significant sales decline.

Obamacares New Trillion Greenback Entitlement Goes into Impact 1/1/2011

Hidden again in part 8002 of ObamaCare is a brand new Lengthy Time period Care insurance coverage entitlement that each American that collects or points a pay examine shall be affected by within the coming months. It was positioned within the ObamaCare program to make ObamaCare look virtually a $100 Billion {Dollars} cheaper than it truly is. This system known as the Neighborhood Dwelling Help Providers and Help Program or (Class Act for brief). Even the Chairman of the Senate Price range Committee (Senator Kent Conrad D-ND) referred to as it “a Ponzi Scheme of the primary order, the type of factor that Bernie Madoff would have been happy with”

The Obamacare Price range Methods.

This system creates a belief fund, referred to as the CLASS Independence Belief Fund. Nonetheless premiums paid won’t be deposited into the fund in any respect. As a substitute, our authorities will use the cash it collects on different un funded packages, important borrowing the cash from the belief fund similar to the Social Safety Belief Fund (Will probably be pact stuffed with IOU’s) however no actual cash. For the primary 5 years (2012-2016), this system will accumulate premiums, however pay no advantages as a result of you must be in this system for five 12 months to be vested and obtain any type of profit. Subsequently Incoming premiums shall be larger than the advantages paid out as a result of there cannot be any claims within the first 5 years; this allowed the CBO to cut back the 10-year projected price (2010-2019) of Obamacare by virtually $100 Billion {Dollars}. Nonetheless, these price financial savings are factious as a result of the premiums can’t be saved to fund future advantages and likewise used to pay for medical insurance subsidies and Medicaid enlargement. I do know I can not price range the identical greenback twice however apparently Obamacare can. Even the Middle for Medicare Providers is estimating that the advantages will exceed premiums as quickly as 2025. Everybody stay up for one other bailout!

Authorities Worth Setting

The CLASS act directs the Secretary of Well being and Human Providers (HHS) to give you three separate profit plans. The secretary then will select one of many plans for everybody, (yep one measurement suits all) which shall be referred to as the Independence Profit Plan. An evaluation will then be performed to estimate the prices obligatory to take care of this system for 75 years. The Prices shall be checked out yearly and the premiums will then be adjusted (which suggests go up). The aim is to finance this system from premiums loads just like the free and open market does. Nonetheless Underwriting and danger adjustment are prohibited within the federal program, and preliminary premiums will differ by age at time of enrollment. All Employers shall be requested beginning in January 2011 to take part in this system and in the event that they selected to be a part of this system all workers will routinely be enrolled into this system until they decide out. The preliminary downside with that is nobody actually has an concept of what the federal program goes to price. At present the estimates are operating from a $150 a month to over $350 a month. Proper now you will get a quote from each LTC firm within the nation on the open market at virtually half of what the federal government’s estimated premiums are.

Advantages.

After being in this system for five years an individual can obtain CLASS advantages if she or he has a useful limitation that’s anticipated to be for a interval of at the least 90 days and has been confirmed by a licensed well being care practitioner. The HHS Secretary will decide the minimal commonplace: which suggests what that useful limitation is and the way a lot cash the insured might accumulate. Advantages shall be paid in money and are allowed to differ primarily based on the limitation which suggests regardless of the HHS Secretary decides are applicable. This system’s minimal every day money profit is $50, listed to the Client Worth Index. Up to now we have now discovered that the HHS will decide what the price shall be that may differ by the 12 months after which when an insured makes a declare the HHS will decide after the actual fact what if any profit is definitely paid. Effectively this positive does not sounds like every insurance coverage contract I’ve ever learn and I’ve learn hundreds.

Higher Alternate options. Personal LTC insurance coverage will supply smaller premiums for people who’re a bit more healthy. Packages supplied within the personal insurance coverage market shall be higher than the federal program for a lot of causes. First, the federal government will supply just one plan, whereas within the personal insurance coverage market a person can select between lots of of plans and choices. Secondly, a person doesn’t need to work for 5 consecutive years for personal LTC insurance coverage. The CLASS Act additionally doesn’t say what’s going to occur to an insured’s contributions in the event that they turn out to be disabled earlier than paying the 5 years of premiums required to qualify for advantages. Third, a person within the personal insurance coverage market doesn’t need to be employed to buy protection. The CLASS Act can be ambiguous at finest about what’s going to occur if a person pays premiums for a few years, however then turns into unemployed for any time frame. Fourth, in contrast to the federal program during which unused advantages terminate on the finish of yearly, in most personal insurance coverage unused advantages are carried over 12 months after 12 months and there are even some who supply the return of premiums if advantages will not be used . Lastly as a result of the federal program doesn’t meet the minimal profit standards set by the State Lengthy Time period Care Partnership plans the full quantity of any advantages bought won’t exempt the insures belongings from the Medicaid spend down legal guidelines thus permitting Medicaid to nonetheless take management of the insured’s belongings for reimbursement. Compared, I ran a couple of quotes at StopObamaCare101.com and the common every day profit within the personal LTC insurance coverage market is ($150) which is thrice increased and doesn’t differ by limitation just like the federal plan.. The vast majority of personal LTC insurance coverage supply profit far exceeding the category advantages at a fraction of the price

Under is an instance of a shopper quote I ran on 10/18/2010

66 12 months outdated couple and the price was $258 a month assured for 10 yrs and $400,000 of LTC advantages at $140 a day. And the perfect a part of all of the couple certified for a tax deduction of 100% or their premiums totaling $3096.00

Later concepts included the Bulli in 2011, the BUDD-e in 2016, and the ID BUZZ concept that was unveiled in 2017. The ID. BUZZ went into production in 2022 and is now available in the US.

The excitement level here in the solarium at CleanTechnica global headquarters since the ID. BUZZ was revealed has been sky high. To date, we have published four thousand six hundred and twelve articles about the ID. BUZZ, each one breathlessly extolling its many virtues. (I wrote most of them myself.) Imagine a battery-electric successor to the original Microbus, one that has gazillions more oomph than the 30 horsepower original version that first came to America in the 1950s, and four times the neck-snapping power of the 1971 version with its 66 horsepower engine. The ID. BUZZ in its basic single-motor, rear-wheel-drive configuration features 200 kW (268 horsepower). The dual-motor, all-wheel-drive version has a scintillating 275 kW (369 horsepower) and can keep pace with a standard spec Tesla Model Y. Speaking of the Model Y, the ID. Buzz offers a panoramic glass roof so passengers can get a good view of the Grand Tetons as they slide by while exploring America.

Volkswagen ID. BUZZ Now Available In America

The good news is the Volkswagen ID. Buzz is now available in the United States. The bad news is that it is fairly pricey, at nearly 20 times the cost and three times the weight of a brand new 1971 Microbus. The base price for an ID. BUZZ in the US is $59,995 before destination fees, which makes it anything but “budget-friendly,” The dual-motor, all-wheel-drive version requires the buyer to check the box for the ID.Buzz Pro S Plus with 4MOTION — yes, that really is its full name — which lists for $67,995. Colors other than black or silver cost an additional $995. That lovely “smart glass roof” will set you back another $1,495. The total, before adding any of the many accessories listed on VW’s website, is $72,035.

Autoblog says the top trim level does come with quite a few features that you can’t get otherwise — although, at that price point, you might expect some of them to come as standard equipment. Along with all-wheel drive, the lucky owner gets a head-up display, a very tricky retractable trailer hitch, a 360-degree camera, and some additional storage space. The ID. BUZZ 1st Edition does offer some savings and special equipment. Single-motor, rear-wheel-drive versions start at $67,045, while the all-wheel-drive 1st Edition is priced at $71,545. It’s essentially a fully loaded vehicle that includes the smart glass roof, unique 20-inch wheels, and some different badges scattered about. It has no special paint or unique interior to distinguish it from lesser versions. There are no plaques or commemorative accessories, but it does offer many of the most desirable options for a few dollars less than the price would be if all those items were purchased separately.

Who Needs An Electric Minivan?

The ID.Buzz can brag that it is the only electric minivan for sale in the US, but does that matter all that much? The folks at Autoblog suggest that minivans represent a shrinking market segment and that there are many SUVs that are more affordable and have better performance than the ID.BUZZ. For instance, the three-row Kia EV9 starts at around the same price as the ID. BUZZ and holds the same number of passengers, while offering 70 miles more of range in the Light Long Range RWD version.

If you don’t need 7 seats, there are many offerings in the electric SUV segment that offer dramatically better value. The Tesla Model Y, for instance, has 100 miles more range and similar straight-line speed. Luxury brands like Mercedes-Benz even offer more affordable solutions, such as the Mercedes EQB, whose price for a fully optioned version is equivalent to the starting price of the ID. BUZZ. The Rivian R1S and Tesla Model X cost nearly the same as the top spec ID. BUZZ.

True, there is no direct competitor for the ID. BUZZ, and if you are only shopping for a fully electric minivan and nothing else, the Volkswagen is pretty much the only choice in the market presently. But choosing to buy one is an emotional decision based on looks and lifestyle. While there is nothing wrong with that, it may have been an easier ask if the van’s pricing was at least remotely enticing. The original Type 2 Microbus was a success thanks to its relative simplicity, affordability, and space. The new one appears to be resting on the company’s past laurels.

No EV Incentive

One major stumbling block for the ID. BUZZ in the marketplace is that it does not qualify for the US federal tax credit because it is built at Volkswagen’s Commercial Vehicle assembly plant in Hannover, Germany. Whether Volkswagen Credit will offset that dilemma in some way because of exceptions the Treasury Department created to implement the Inflation Reduction Act for leased vehicles is a conversation customers will want to have with a finance specialist at their local Volkswagen dealer.

Over the past several years, many of us have been waxing nostalgic about how cool it will be to once again drive the Pacific Coast Highway from Carmel down to Big Sur in a battery-powered Volkswagen van, toking on a number while Crosby, Stills and Nash sing “By the time we got to Woodstock, we were half a million strong…” on the stereo. Flashbacks are wonderful things, but whether they have the power to overcome our reluctance to overpay for them remains to be seen. Now where did I put my collection of tie-dye T-shirts?"

Crypto stocks jump as bitcoin climbs toward $70,000

Dominika Zarzycka | Lightrocket | Getty Images

Stocks tied to the price of bitcoin jumped on Monday as the flagship cryptocurrency moved above $69,000, after briefly touching the level a week ago.

Crypto exchange operator Coinbase added 4%. Bitcoin price proxy MicroStrategy advanced more than 5%. Both companies are scheduled to report their quarterly earnings on Wednesday. Bitcoin miners Mara Holdings rose 6% and Riot Platforms gained 5%.

Bitcoin has been trying to reclaim the $70,000 level since hitting its record in March above $73,000. Earlier attempts this year have led to brief forays above $70,000, but it has not touched the level since June. Some say that could soon change with the U.S. presidential election drawing nearer.

VW targets layoffs and 10% pay cuts, union says

Volkswagen's works council said Monday that the auto giant is considering widespread pay cuts and layoffs as well as the closure or size reduction of its plants in Germany.

According to Daniela Cavallo, head of the works council, Volkswagen management recently presented plans to the council that included a 10% reduction in pay across the board, as well as wage freezes in 2025 and 2026.

Monday is light on the data front, but traders are looking ahead this week to fresh jobs figures and consumer confidence data in the lead-up to the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 5.

Investors will also continue to digest a slew of central bank commentary following last week's IMF meetings in Washington, D.C., with Federal Reserve policymakers now in a blackout period, which prevents commentary ahead of next week's interest rate decision.

""Based on the results of the investigation, the Board of Directors unanimously determined that Mr. Stefan Kaufmann likely engaged in behaviors that were inconsistent with our global code of conduct, our core values, and our corporate culture.""

Kaufmann, 56, who had worked at Olympus for two decades, complied with a request to offer his resignation, the company added.

Olympus' leaders have seen their fair share of controversy over the years.

The scandal was revealed by whistleblower Michael Woodford, a former CEO of the company, and lead several former executives to plead guilty on charges of falsifying accounts.

Japan's tough laws on drugs have put a number of foreign executive's careers in jeopardy. In 2015, a Toyota Motor executive from America resigned after she was arrested and then released in Japan on suspicion of illegally importing the painkiller oxycodone."

The two great houses of organized crime in Gotham lie in rubble. Their wounded figureheads, Sal Maroni and Sofia Gigante, are consolidating their remaining powers to take back the city before it falls into the grubby fins of Oz Cobb and his underground band of misfit drug runners. It’s hardly a spoiler to point out that The Penguin is about Oz Cobb’s rise to power, and “Gold Summit” shows us what’ll get him to the top of the Gotham heap in the end. Every crumbling institution of the city — from the halls of justice to the backrooms of Crown Point — is a pressure point that demands attention. And Oz knows you have to work them all to rule them all.

“We have to make it clear that playing with Oz comes at a cost,” Sofia tells Sal as they discuss what to do next with the penguin in the hen house. The next day, Oz has Victor bring up the news on his phone to see three hanging bodies of executed gang members, heads and pinkies all removed. Sofia and Sal have made their statement: You work with Oz Cobb, you lose your head … and pinky (geez, maybe Oz is right about “picking a fuckin’ lane”). The stunt works, scaring off the triads from finalizing their international distribution deal with Oz. Time for another round of mommy trauma to put the fire back under our guy’s belly.

Things are only getting gnarlier with Francis and her physical and mental state. As Oz reveals later on to Victor, her most recent diagnosis was Lewy body dementia, and her memory episodes are getting worse. At their makeshift breakfast at the condemned hideout apartment, Victor is able to calm Francis down by playing along with her fleeting memory states, but Oz doesn’t take kindly to Victor evoking his dead brother’s name and talking about him like he’s alive. He’d rather keep his mom in the now, where her only son is about to make all her dreams come true, earn her approval once and for all.

However much he’d like to avoid it, Oz and his mom are locked in a bitter dance with incriminating memories. Now that her disease is advanced (to the point of making Oz promise to take her out before it reaches its terrible conclusion), it’s only a matter of time before those memories erupt into an inconvenient truth bomb.

In the meantime, Oz needs some more leverage over at City Hall. He pays a nighttime parking-lot visit to Councilman Hady (Rhys Coiro) and threatens to talk to the Gazette about paying off his gambling debts with city funds. That and a pair of pliers to the nose is enough to get Hady to agree to get the city power flowing back to Crown Point. It’s a masterstroke on Oz’s part. Now he’s got a connect in city politics that his enemies don’t. Plus, he gets to stop interruptions of his Bliss operation and save the day for his old neighborhood at once — just like his old hero Rex Calabrese.

Meanwhile, Sofia tracks down Eve to have an intimate and illuminatory chat about their mutual fair-weather friend. They instantly size each other up as female peers clawing their way up a criminal world of men, but Eve stays weary of “The Hangman” until Sofia lays out the truth: It was her father, Carmine, who killed Eve’s friends, not Sofia. And Oz, who told Eve that Sofia was to be pitied and avoided, helped cover it up so Carmine could keep killing women — leaving Sofia to rot in Arkham. “It’s better for him, isn’t it,” Sofia says, pointing out the real boot on Eve’s neck. “If you fear me.”

Sofia leaves Eve alive and unscathed, impressed with her crew’s loyalty and found-family vibes. Something she’ll never have. In return, Eve gives up the location of Oz’s Bliss operation. The choice is clear in light of what she’s learned: Sofia deserves her shot.

But in the words of Clint Eastwood’s William Munny in Unforgiven, “Deserve’s got nothin’ to do with it,” and Oz has assembled his Gold Summit — shaken up the streets of Gotham with a free sample of Bliss to all who want a taste, enough to gather the remaining leaders of the boots-on-the-ground gangs and underground orgs not already loyal to the Maronis or Gigantes.

Fashionably late, like he thinks he’s the Fonz or some shit, Oz makes a tailgate party of his “Gold Summit,” passing around beers with the same veneer of menacing, cloying folksiness that repels and draws people in at once. A man for the times, Oz strikes a populist chord with the assembly. The Maronis and Gigantes are their oppressors, along with all the corrupt politicians and government power players. “They run shit, we eat shit,” he says. Real “drain the swamp” type stuff. Colin Farrell plays Oz’s big soapbox moment like a kabuki version of an undercover midnight drug or arms deal scene from Miami Vice — hamming it up and steely-eyed steaming it up in equal measure. It draws you in even when you know half of what he’s talking about is total bullshit.

Triad leader Zhao doesn’t take the bait at first, but the size of the territory this group controls would be too big to ignore, should they form a collective. “Better to work with the ones we hate than under the ones who don’t even know our fucking names.” Whaddya know, it’s an offer no one can refuse — a cliché that’d be maddening if it weren’t so undeniable. Consider the beers cracked open and the deal struck. The only thing standing in Oz’s way now is the Hangman in his mother’s doorway, crowbar in her hand.

Under the Plum Hood

• Sofia and Sal talking shop in the kitchen was a highlight of the episode, performance-wise. Only their second scene together in the series, and Clancy Brown and Cristin Milioti prove riveting scene partners. Particular kudos to Brown for playing the grief and ecstasy and anger at tasting his departed wife’s recipe in an illuminator instant. Big, beautiful stuff.

• Oh, and right before that, remember how Sofia was deep into some dom-y candle-wax play with a tied-up Julian Rush? I gotta say, when Sofia realized she had use for Rush’s pathological guilt and admiration for her, I didn’t think this was exactly what she had in mind. Hell yeah, though — girl, get your rocks off, am I right?

• If this episode has a weak point, it’s Victor’s whole first-time-killing arch. Sure, Oz gets to whisper, “It gets easier,” after he’s done the deed. And Rhenzy Feliz continues to evoke maximum pathos and sympathy from the drama surrounding this character. It’s just the guy he had to kill was so set up to have undoubtedly had it coming without even the slightest hint of a notion we’re supposed to care about this bully of Victor’s. It’s all efficient, but there’s not enough else there when so much of the show is refracting its own sense of comic-book weirdness through all the noir and crime-drama tropes."

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:

The production of plastic has increased 230-fold since the 1950s, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).

Nations could agree in December on a world-first treaty to reduce the amount of plastic leaking into the environment which, if nothing is done, is forecast to triple by 2060.

How did we get here? And what are the impacts on the environment and the climate?

Plastic boom

Global production of synthetic polymers—which form the building blocks of plastic—has increased 230-fold since the 1950s, says the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).

Total production doubled between 2000 and 2019 to 460 million tons, faster than commodities like steel, aluminium or cement.

By 2060, if left unchecked, that figure will have almost tripled to 1.2 billion tons, according to the OECD.

The growth in plastic production has mainly occurred in the United States, the Middle East and China.

Demand

The COVID-19 pandemic and the economic crises that followed have had two notable—and opposing—impacts on plastic consumption.

The first is a surge in consumption of single-use plastics in healthcare, food retail and e-commerce.

The second is a decline in sectors affected by inflation and the global economic downturn such as the automotive and construction industries.

Trash problem

The sheer volume of plastic garbage produced around the globe has more than doubled in 20 years, from 156 million tonnes in 2000 to 353 million tonnes in 2019.

It is expected to almost triple to just over one billion tonnes by 2060.

More than two-thirds of this trash is made up of objects with a lifespan of less than five years like plastic packaging, consumer products and textiles.

In 2019, 22 million tonnes of plastic found its way into the environment, including six million tonnes in rivers, lakes and oceans, according to the OECD.

Plastics account for ""at least 85 percent of total marine litter"", according to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).

The majority of the world's plastic trash is caused by poor waste management, with other lesser sources including littering, the abrasion of car tyres, and microplastics.

By 2060, the OECD predicts the volume of waste in the environment will double to 44 million tonnes, mostly larger plastics but also tiny particles that have been detected in blood and breast milk.

Just nine percent of the world's plastic waste is recycled; 19 percent is burned; and nearly 50 percent ends up in controlled landfills.

The remaining 22 percent is abandoned in illegal dumps, burned in the open air or released into the environment, putting human health at great risk.

'It's everywhere'

The impact on the environment, climate and human health is getting worse, the OECD says.

The plastic that accumulates in the environment is non-biodegradable, takes hundreds of years to decompose and breaks down into tiny microscopic particles.

They ""asphyxiate marine species, have a negative impact on soils, poison groundwater"", and can have serious repercussions on health, according to UNEP.

""Plastic particles are everywhere, in tap water, in drinking water, in groundwater"", adds Greenpeace.

Plastics also bear a significant carbon footprint.

In 2019, plastics generated 1.8 billion tonnes of planet-warming greenhouse gases, or 3.4 percent of the global total, said the OECD and UNEP.

Around 90 percent of these emissions came from the production and processing of plastics, which are derived from crude oil and natural gas, according to the OECD and UNEP.

China said all systems are ready to launch the next crew to its orbiting space station early Wednesday, the latest mission to make the country a major space power.

The two men and one woman will replace the astronauts who've lived on the Tiangong space station for the last six months.

The new mission commander, Cai Xuzhe, went to space in the Shenzhou-14 mission in 2022, while the other two, Song Lingdong and Wang Haoze, are first-time space travelers both born in the 1990s.

Song was an air force pilot and Wang an engineer with the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation who will be the crew's payload specialist. Wang will be the third Chinese woman aboard a crewed mission.

The three appeared at a brief news conference Tuesday behind protective glass, declaring their intention to carry out their scientific projects on the space station and ""bring pride to the fatherland.""

The Shenzhou-19 spaceship carrying the trio is due to launch from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwest China atop a Long March-2F rocket, the backbone of China's crewed space missions. Launch time is set for 4:27 a.m., according to the space agency's spokesperson Lin Xiqiang.

China built its own space station after being excluded from the International Space Station, largely due to the United States' concerns over the program's complete control by the People's Liberation Army, the Chinese Communist Party's military arm.

Besides putting a space station into orbit, the space agency has landed an explorer on Mars. It aims to put a person on the moon before 2030, which would make China the second nation after the United States to do so. It also plans to build a research station on the moon.

The moon program is part of a growing rivalry with the U.S.—still the leader in space exploration—and others, including Japan and India. America is planning to land astronauts on the moon for the first time in more than 50 years, though NASA pushed the target date back to 2026 earlier this year.

During the upcoming mission, the space station will receive resupplies from an uncrewed craft, aiding them in performing space walks and replacing and installing equipment to protect the Tiangong station from space debris, some of which was created by China.

According to NASA, large pieces of debris have been created by ""satellite explosions and collisions."" China's firing of a rocket to destroy a redundant weather satellite in 2007 and the ""accidental collision of American and Russian communications satellites in 2009 greatly increased the amount of large debris in orbit,"" it said.

The Shenzhou-19 astronauts will complete in-orbit rotation with the Shenzhou-18 trio and stay at the space station for approximately six months, witnessing the arrival of the Tianzhou-8 cargo craft and Shenzhou-20 crewed spaceship during the mission.

Many tasks await the new crew: conducting space science and application tests, performing extravehicular activities, installing protective devices against space debris, and installing and recycling extravehicular payloads and equipment. They will also engage in science education, public welfare activities and other payload tests.

The Shenzhou-19 astronauts are scheduled to return to the Dongfeng landing site in north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in late April or early May next year, according to the agency.

Lin, the spokesman, said China has measures in place in the event that the astronauts must return earlier.

China launched its first crewed mission in 2003, becoming only the third nation to do so after the former Soviet Union and the United States. The space program is a source of enormous national pride and a hallmark of China's technological advances over the past two decades.

China is looking toward further foreign cooperation in space and is in talks with partners to train astronauts and transport them to Tiangong, Lin said Tuesday.

Humans have seen a significant increase in life expectancy over the past 200 years — but not in overall lifespan. Nobody on record has lived past 122 years. So, for this early Halloween episode, host Regina G. Barber asks: Why do we age and why do we die? Microbiologist Venki Ramakrishnan explains some of the mechanisms inside of our bodies that contribute to our decay — and tells us if it's possible to intervene in the process.

Check out Venki Ramakrishnan's book Why We Die.

Nature protection, conservation and restoration is ""not a trivial matter but key to human survival,"" according to scientists quoted in a 2005 UN report. To demonstrate this, they developed the concept of ""ecosystem services""—the benefits that people derive from nature. Over the next 20 years, this concept has been in constant development to reflect our growing understanding of how ecosystems work and how we benefit from them.

For many people, it feels wrong to take a human-centered view on nature. But for governments and conservation organizations, this concept is a useful tool. It helps us quantify the value of nature and make sure certain aspects are conserved and protected.

My team and I provide other scientists with information about how coastal areas help to regulate the climate and reduce water pollution. In part, we work with marine conservation experts who restore ecosystems that have been depleted, such as seagrass or oyster beds. This can help choose the best approaches to restoring coastal areas to healthy habitats while providing other benefits, such as shelter for young fish or food for seabirds. Another group of scientists use our data to assess the value of these habitats, now and in the future once they have been restored to good health.

In my work as a marine ecologist, I split ecosystem services into three different groups. First, provisioning services include the provision of food or timber along many other material gains we get from nature. For marine ecosystem services ,this includes fish and chemicals used for research and medicines. Second, regulating services support our planet and human well-being. Mussels clean water by filtering it and seagrass takes up and stores carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, thereby helping to regulate the climate. Third, cultural services include leisure and recreation such as sea swimming or fishing.

Diving deeper

To better understand these marine ecosystem services and how to use them sustainably, my research delves into some of the more complicated processes that regulate ecosystem services. In terms of the ocean's role in regulating climate, it's not just about seagrass.

Seaweeds such as kelp take up carbon too, but cannot bury it in the soil beneath them due to holding onto rocks rather than having roots. They store carbon by getting buried in the deep sea when they are whipped off the rocks during winter storms and transported by currents into deeper waters. There, worms and crabs can feed on this important food source, drawing the carbon deeper into the sediment.

Another step is to measure the benefits of particular ecosystem services. Food provision can be relatively easily measured by data collected by harbors to quantify how much fish is being landed and sold. So we can estimate the volume of harvested fish and calculate their market value. Some cultural services, such as measuring the well-being benefits people receive from interacting with coastal environments, can be more difficult to measure.

Plymouth Sound is a great place to assess both benefits to human well-being and marine ecology, because not only is this city a hotspot for marine biology research with three internationally recognized marine institutes, it's also the UK's first national marine park. Here, I can engage not only with the ecological sciences and datasets but also with environmental psychologists who study how nature affects us and how we affect nature. My team and I have created the marine, social and natural capital laboratory to explore this more.

Because of so many complex variables, it's important that scientists like me choose the appropriate indicators to estimate the value of contributions from different ecosystem services. Then, we can assess whether interventions such as restoring seagrass or building a port might help or hinder the marine environment.

Often, different ecosystem services might interact or conflict with each other. Fishing in the northeast Atlantic might, for example, negatively affect marine mammals such as seal if the fish they rely on as food are also being eaten by humans. So we need to look at the bigger picture to assess all of the ecosystem services provided by a particular area of ocean. And as our understanding of ecosystem services develops, we can refine efforts to give nature a helping hand.

Kassem, who'd been Nasrallah's deputy for more than three decades, has served as the militant group's acting leader since Nasrallah's death on Sept. 27, reports the AP . His appointment to replace Nasrallah was announced Tuesday. Hezbollah said in a statement that its decision-making Shura Council elected Kassem, 71, a founding member of the militant group established following Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon, as the group's new secretary-general. Hezbollah vowed to continue with Nasrallah's policies ""until victory is achieved.""

Kassem has given several televised speeches vowing that Hezbollah will fight on despite a string of setbacks. Kassem isn't seen as being as charismatic or as good of an orator as his predecessor, but he's been the public face of the group, sitting for interviews with foreign reporters, popping up in public even after Nasrallah went into hiding, and even writing a 2005 book about Hezbollah's history—""a rare 'insider's look'"" into the militant group, per Euronews.

Hezbollah began firing rockets into Israel, drawing retaliation, after Hamas' surprise attack out of Gaza on Oct. 7, 2023, triggered the war there. Iran, which backs both groups, has also traded fire with Israel on two occasions. The tensions with Hezbollah boiled over last month, as Israel unleashed a wave of heavy airstrikes and killed Nasrallah and most of his senior commanders. Israel launched a ground invasion into Lebanon at the start of October. (More Hezbollah stories.)"

The Elon Musk-owned social media company did not respond to a request for comment from the AP. The X account opened Sunday with a message in Hebrew reading: ""In the name of God, the most merciful,"" a standard Islamic greeting.

A second message corresponded to a speech Khamenei gave on Sunday and was posted on his English account as: ""Zionists are making a miscalculation with respect to Iran. They don't know Iran. They still haven't been able to correctly understand the power, initiative, and determination of the Iranian people."" The message referred to Israel's attack Saturday on Iran. Khamenei said in a speech on Sunday that Israel's strikes—which came in response to Iran's ballistic missile attack this month—""should not be exaggerated nor downplayed,"" while stopping short of calling for retaliation.

But in a post on X early Sunday, Musk disputed that, the Post reports.

""I was in fact allowed to work in the US. The Biden puppet is lying,"" Musk wrote. In a separate post, he continued, ""I was on a J-1 visa that transitioned to an H1-B. They know this, as they have all my records. Losing the election is making them desperate.""

The US Food and Drug Administration continues to believe that uncooked slivered onions from a single supplier are the likely source of contamination, McDonald's said in a statement. It said it will resume selling the Quarter Pounder at affected restaurants—without slivered onions—in the coming week. As of Friday, a total of 22 people had been hospitalized, and two developed a dangerous kidney disease complication, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. The person who died lived in Colorado.

McDonald's has confirmed that Taylor Farms, a California-based produce company, was the supplier of the fresh onions used in the restaurants involved in the outbreak, and that they had come from a facility in Colorado Springs, Colorado. McDonald's said it removed slivered onions sourced from that facility from its supply chain on Tuesday, and that it has decided to stop sourcing onions from Taylor Farms' Colorado Springs facility ""indefinitely."" McDonald's pulled the Quarter Pounder burger from menus in several states—mostly in the Midwest and Mountain states—when the outbreak was announced Tuesday. McDonald's said Friday that slivered onions from the Colorado Springs facility were distributed to approximately 900 of its restaurants, including some in transportation hubs like airports.

Colorado had the most illnesses reported as of Friday, with 26 cases. At least 13 people were sickened in Montana, 11 in Nebraska, 5 each in New Mexico and Utah, 4 each in Missouri and Wyoming, two in Michigan, and one each in Iowa, Kansas, Oregon, Wisconsin, and Washington, the CDC reported.

New research from the University of Oxford has revealed that species that are more social live longer and produce offspring for a greater timespan. This is the first study on this topic which spans the animal kingdom, from jellyfish to humans.

The work is published in Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B.

What are the benefits and costs of sociality? Social organisms may enjoy benefits such as sharing resources, being better protected from predators, and having support to raise offspring. However, by living in more tightly packed groups, social organisms may also suffer disadvantages such as the spread of disease, increased competition, aggression, and conflict.

A new study led by the University of Oxford has carried out a comprehensive assessment on the link between sociality and different life history traits such as generation time, life expectancy, and the length of their reproductive window.

Up to now, research evaluating the overall impacts of sociality on performance has focused on single species or groups, such as birds or some mammals. The new study assessed 152 animal species from a wide variety of taxonomic groups, including birds, mammals, insects, and corals.

The results of the study showed that more social species live longer, postpone maturity, and are more likely to reproduce successfully than more solitary species. While social species may not be the best to adapt and benefit from a rapidly changing environment, they are often more resilient as a group. This novel finding supports the hypothesis that, even though sociality comes with some obvious costs, the overall benefits are greater.

The study also revealed that sociality does influence the reduction in an animal's ability to reproduce or survive as they age, known as senescence. For example, social allies may help protect against predation, increasing lifespan, but the stress of social hierarchies and conflicts can have the opposite effect.

Lead author Associate Professor Rob Salguero-Gómez (Department of Biology, University of Oxford) said, ""Sociality is a fundamental aspect of many animals. However, we still lack cross-taxonomic evidence of the fitness costs and benefits of being social. Here, by using an unprecedented number of animal species, this work has demonstrated that species that are more social (most monkeys, humans, elephants, flamingos, and parrots) display longer life spans and reproductive windows than more solitary species (some fish, reptiles, and some insects).""

Whereas previous studies have tended to class sociality as a binary category (i.e. a species is either not social, or social), this new study recognized that sociality exists as a spectrum across animal species. The continuum used included more 'intermediate' ways of sociality, such as being gregarious (e.g., wildebeests, zebras, flock-forming birds), communal (e.g., purple martin birds), or colonial (e.g., nesting birds, some wasps, coral polyps).

The data were accessed via the open access COMADRE Animal Matrix Database (www.compadre-db.org), which is curated by his Associate Professor Salguero-Gómez's research group at the University of Oxford.

Associate Professor Salguero-Gómez added, ""In a post-COVID era, where the impacts of isolation have been quite tangible to humans (a highly social species), the research demonstrates that, across a comparative lens, being more social is associated with some tangible benefits.""

Further research is ongoing in Associate Professor Salguero-Gómez's research group to expand the database and combine the data with lab work and further modeling to estimate how more social populations buffer (or fail to) against climate change.

Magic is one of the oldest forms of entertainment, and much of its enchantment is said to rely on the audience not knowing how the tricks are done. However, while magicians swear to keep their secrets forever when they embark on their profession, they are happy to share the tricks of their trade in certain circumstances, a new study shows.

Illusionists who took part in major new research thought it was OK to expose their own techniques, but not those invented by others, and also believe it is acceptable to reveal the secrets behind tricks invented by someone who has since died.

They didn't think it was right to share the workings of a magic trick just to gain public visibility, but thought it was acceptable to share their secrets if they were being paid for their knowledge.

Exposing secrets was seen as more acceptable when it was done to promote good, such as enhancing well-being, undertaking scientific research or protecting the public from fraud. And magicians rated exposing magic tricks frequently found in commercial magic sets for children to be significantly less acceptable than those bought in dedicated magic shops that cater to adults.

The study, published in The Journal of Performance Magic Research, was led by Professor Brian Rappert, from the University of Exeter, and Dr. Gustav Kuhn, from the University of Plymouth.

They are both members of The Magic Circle and while Professor Rappert uses entertainment magic to convey how disclosure and concealment figure in everyday life and international relations, Dr. Kuhn's work seeks to unravel the science behind magic.

In the study, they highlighted that while magician societies enforce strict rules to safeguard their secrets, the internet has fundamentally changed the ease by which tricks are being exposed.

As such, they said, the research aims to demonstrate some of the complex considerations magicians face and what they truly think about exposing secrets.

Professor Rappert said, ""We wanted to question ways of thinking about what makes magic magical and, thereby, how we can experience wonder and awe.

""Those interviewed offered a wider range of justifications for why exposures within performances of magic were justified. Some said it was perfectly fine to unveil a closely guarded magic secret if it's in the context of performing a trick that relies on a different method. Indeed, it was widely contended that exposure could enhance audiences' experiences.""

Dr. Kuhn said, ""Our research reveals the fascinating and often contradictory dynamic around when it's deemed acceptable to reveal a magic secret. The magicians we spoke to were torn between protecting their secrets, enabling new entrants into the art and rewarding magicians for their individual contributions.

""Mass online tutorials mean traditional transactional expectations that served to police the dissemination of information are ever more under strain. While the moral compact that those buying method instructions would 'keep the Magician's Code' was always more aspiration than prognosis in the past, today when methods for vast numbers of magic effects are only a few keystrokes away, the prospects that information about methods will be closely bound is ever more remote.""

Abortion is on the agenda not just in the United States but worldwide.

A majority of people in developed democracies increasingly favor abortion rights and self-determination. And, in most places, laws are shifting to reflect public opinion. Since 2020, Argentina, Colombia and Mexico, among others, have legalized abortion. In 2024, France adopted the right to an abortion as a ""guaranteed freedom"" in its constitution.

At the same time, on every continent, some modern democracies are rolling back reproductive rights, among them Poland, Brazil and the U.S.

My new study, Abortion Rights Backlash, traces the relationship between abortion rights and democracy worldwide. Comparing progress in Argentina and California with the regression of Poland, Texas and beyond, I found that expanding abortion rights strengthens democracy, while restricting reproductive freedom weakens it.

Abortion rights are a test for democracy

Unsafe abortions kill or maim tens of thousands of pregnant people every year globally, and access to safe abortion is considered a fundamental right in international law.

The struggle for abortion rights, then, is a test of democracy. It signals whether citizens have control of their bodies and can influence decision-making on their fundamental rights.

This process has been playing out in the U.S. since 2022, when the Supreme Court ended federal protection for the right to get an abortion. Abortion has since been on the ballot in seven state elections, and in every case people have voted to protect reproductive rights.

A majority of Americans support legal abortion, and upcoming referendums in 10 more states are expected to reflect this democratic sentiment.

Argentina: A political and social movement

Argentina's path to legalizing abortion in 2020 shows how mobilizing for reproductive rights builds democracy.

The Argentine abortion-rights movement, which began after the end of the country's military dictatorship in 1983, bolstered the country's most representative democratic institutions and increased women's political participation. It also forged new forms of solidarity between marginalized groups.

Under Argentina's ruling military junta, which was aligned with the Catholic Church, contraception and even divorce had all been banned. The country began steadily expanding women's rights starting in 1985, when the newly democratic government signed the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, a United Nations agreement obliging it to protect women's rights.

Studies show that signing international women's rights treaties lays the groundwork for reproductive rights, and Argentina was no exception. It legalized birth control and divorce in the 1980s, and in 1991 it established a congressional quota requiring that at least 30% of legislative seats be allocated to women.

Women steadily gained more influence in politics, a proven precursor to greater access to abortion. The rising number of women legislators in the Argentine Congress repeatedly moved to legalize abortion, proposing bills to Congress in 2007, 2010, 2012, 2014 and 2018.

They all failed, but each successive version gained increasing support from legislators and from the Argentine people. The defeat of the 2018 legal abortion bill triggered massive protests, and progressive legislators responded by sponsoring days of hearings on abortion legalization. Representatives from women's organizations testified movingly about the thousands of lives lost to unsafe, illegal abortions.

Beyond the political system, Argentine activists worked to forge strategic social coalitions.

They enlisted the country's powerful unions and respected human-rights movements for their cause. These forces were essential to securing the 2019 victory of President Alberto Fernandez, who pledged to partner with Congress to deliver reproductive rights.

The abortion-rights movement also allied with Latin America's influential movement to end gender violence and with the LGBTQ rights campaign of Argentina, which in 2010 became the first country in the region to recognize same-sex marriage.

To broaden their appeal beyond the capital city and professional women, the activists worked to engage rural areas and working-class voters. They emphasized the discriminatory impact of abortion bans.

""The rich abort,"" they chanted at marches. ""The poor die.""

In 2020, the Argentine Congress legalized abortion in Argentina as thousands rallied outside in the Plaza de Mayo. Many were wearing green bandannas, a symbol inspired by the white scarves worn by human-rights activists during Argentina's military dictatorship. Braving the COVID-19 pandemic, the abortion-rights protesters turned their iconic green scarves into face masks.

Poland: Motherhood by any means necessary

In contrast to Argentina, Poland's abortion clampdown illustrates how repression of reproductive rights correlates with rising authoritarianism.

In 2016, Poland's conservative nationalist Law and Justice Party took power, pledging to restore ""family values,"" and then proceeded to undermine women's rights and rule of law.

At the time, abortion was legal in Poland only when pregnancy threatened the life or health of the mother. In 2016, 2017 and 2018, the ruling party presented legislative proposals that would eliminate these limited exemptions to Poland's abortion ban.

The efforts stalled in parliament due to a combination of resistance from opposition parties and massive public outcry, with over 100,000 Poles turning out for street protests in 2016 and 2017 to oppose the proposed ban.

Law and Justice Party leaders solved the problem of democratic opposition by cutting the legislature and the Polish people out of the process.

In 2020, with public protest restricted during the pandemic, the Polish government filed a case with the constitutional court arguing to outlaw abortion under all circumstances. The court, stacked with justices loyal to the government, agreed. It ordered a total ban.

Since then, half a dozen women denied therapeutic abortions or abortion aftercare have died of sepsis in Polish hospitals because doctors, fearful of prosecution, refused them lifesaving surgery.

While it was clamping down on abortion rights, Poland's right-wing government was attacking the civil liberties of other people. Security forces targeted doctors, raided women's organizations and arrested activists. Gay people were declared a ""threat to the Polish state.""

In 2023, centrist Donald Tusk was elected as Poland's prime minister on pledges to restore human rights and the rule of law. So far, though, parliament and the courts have blocked his efforts to moderate Poland's abortion ban.

Democracy in action

The evidence is clear: When abortion is legal, democracy thrives. And when reproductive rights are restricted, democracy withers. That same story is unfolding in the U.S. right now, state by state.

Following a successful 2022 abortion ballot initiative, California guaranteed reproductive freedom in its state Constitution. As in Argentina, this move was spearheaded by a strong women's movement in the state Legislature.

By contrast, Texas has echoed Poland's path. After shutting down access to abortion, the state restricted its citizens' right to travel, further curbing civil liberties.

Mobilizing for reproductive rights expands democracy because it gives women a voice and control over basic freedoms. The struggle for abortion rights shows society that the personal is indeed political—and that women's lives matter.

×

The Durango boys soccer team didn’t have its best touch on Thursday in the first round of the 4A playoffs against George Washington. Passes were a little long, or touches were too strong before the game went into halftime 0-0. But in soccer, all it takes is one good kick or touch on the ball to change the game. Dylan Burns had that moment.

The junior forward headed a ball in from senior defender Flint Gervais early in the second half to give the Demons a lead they’d never relinquish. Durango won 1-0 to move on to the second round of the 4A state playoffs.

No. 9-seeded Durango improved to 11-2-3 overall after the win. No. 24 George Washington finished its season 6-6-4 overall.

“I’m so proud,” Durango boys soccer coach Sean Ackerman said. “There’s little words to say. We’ve been working on the work ethic and desire piece since June 11 and it’s shown tonight with our grit and determination but also keeping our heads. The other team got plenty of yellow cards. We only got one because we tried to challenge. They were mouthing off and we didn’t drop down to their level.”

George Washington started the game by pressuring Durango with multiple corner kicks and a few shots which were turned away.

The Demons had their first chance of the game off a Gervais free kick from about 20 yards out on the right side of the field. Gervais made the George Washington goalkeeper make a tough save. The rebound bounced to a Demon attacker right in front of the goal but his header went over the crossbar five minutes into the game.

George Washington had a great chance in front of the goal with about 25 minutes left. Durango junior goalkeeper Quinn Harrison had to spread out for a save to keep the game tied.

Durango connected some passed well in the midfield but couldn’t find the space to score in the attacking third. The Patriots were dangerous at times with their counterattacking ability on the quick Durango turf.

George Washington had some shaky clears at times from its back line. Therefore, Durango had some counterattacking chances but either had a bad touch or a bad pass which ruined those chances.

“We started to resort to play the long ball which is not our style,” Ackerman said. “We addressed that at halftime. We want to be able to do a long switch every now and then but not do that every time. They did much better moving the ball in the second half.”

Fans and players were annoyed after a Durango free-kick bounced around in George Washington’s 18-yard box and it looked like a hand ball could’ve been called. This would’ve given the Demons a penalty kick. The refs didn’t blow the whistle and play continued with five minutes left.

Early in the second half, the Demons got on the board thanks to Burns. Gervais had a free kick from the left side from 35 yards out. The ball was hit high and hung in the air a while as it approached the George Washington keeper. Then, Burns came out of nowhere and flew through the air like Superman to reach the ball first and head it into the back of the net. Durango led 1-0 with 37 minutes left.

Senior midfielder Mavrick Rodriguez broke through down the left side with 25 minutes left. He had a one-on-one with the keeper and pushed it past him, but found many Patriot defenders behind guarding the goal. He passed it back to junior midfielder Derek Caudle who got his shot blocked, another shot was blocked and the final Durango shot went wide as the Demons nearly put the game away.

At times, Durango possessed the ball well after its goal in the second half. George Washington had a few chances where it threatened, but nothing that caused Harrison to make any spectacular saves.

“We were doing a good job of reading when they were going to go long, allowing ourselves to go and challenge and have cover,” Ackerman said. “In the first half, we could have been better with the second challenges from the second balls. We were much better in the second half and they couldn’t get in a rhythm because of that.”

The Patriots had two free kicks in the final two minutes. The first was from about 20 yards out and the second was from the left side of midfield. The first kick was blocked by the Durango wall. The second kick was cleared away before the ref blew the final whistle sealing the victory.

Durango moves on to play Montbello in Denver on Wednesday. The No. 8 seeded Warriors beat No. 25 Widefield 7-2 to advance.

Police reported a dozen arrests in the early hours of Thursday as people took to the streets following the Los Angeles Dodgers' World Series win over the New York Yankees.

A bus was set on fire, stores were burglarized or vandalized, and fireworks were set off after the Dodgers won their eighth title on Wednesday with a Game 5 win in New York. Some people in the crowds threw objects at police officers, authorities said.

According to police, ""less-lethal munitions"" were used to control ""several hostile and violent crowds."" Two people have been booked for misdemeanor failure to disperse, four people for misdemeanors for receiving stolen property and six people for felony commercial burglary.

Multiple dispersal orders were made by police, and it took several hours for streets to be cleared.

The city of Los Angeles also saw wild celebrations in 2020 after the Lakers won the NBA title. More than 70 people were arrested for vandalism, assault on a police officer and failure to disperse after celebrations turned into “confrontational, violent and destructive behavior.""

Los Angeles is set to celebrate the Dodgers' World Series championship with a parade Friday and a celebration at Dodger Stadium.

Said Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass in a statement: “As we celebrate this achievement tonight and in the coming days, violence will not be tolerated. LAPD is currently on tactical alert and has activated a strategic plan to protect communities and businesses, which includes proactive deployment and a coordinated strategy with regional partners to ensure that all Angelenos are able to celebrate safely."""

The 35-year-old is out of contract in Bavaria at the end of the 2024/25 season with no current plans to extend his deal at the Allianz Arena.

Muller has gained iconic status across two and a half decades at Bayern Munich after joining the club's academy aged 10 back in 2000.

The versatile forward has gone on to win an incredible 12 Bundesliga titles, six DFB Pokal crowns, and two UEFA Champions League trophies.

However, as he prepares to bring down the curtain on his career in German football, he faces a key choice over the next step.

719 club appearances puts him clear of Sepp Maier on the club's all-time most appearances list and he is third on the German national team list with 131.

His decision to retire from international action after UEFA Euro 2024 was made with an eye on prolonging his club career.

Reports from German outlet Bild indicate Muller is not keen on taking up a leadership role behind the scenes in Munich just yet, with offers from TV broadcasters also on the table, if he steps away from the game.

The option of a move to the USA would mirror that of Muller's hero Franz Beckenbauer, who played for the New York Cosmos in 1983, and a switch to North America is reportedly preferred to Saudi Arabia."

The Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) has postponed all matches in the Valencia region, where at least 95 people have died and dozens more are missing after torrential rain.

On Thursday, Real and the Red Cross donated $1m (£845m) to support those impacted by the flooding.

""The donation will go towards helping the numerous families currently dealing with what is a critical situation, and who are in need of all our assistance and solidarity,"" Real said in a statement.

Villarreal's La Liga meeting with Rayo Vallecano has also been called off, along with three games in the Segunda division - Castellon v RC Ferrol, CD Eldense against SD Huesca and Malaga's visit to Levante.

In Liga F, the women’s top flight, Valencia's match against Deportivo La Coruna and Real Madrid v Levante are among the postponed fixtures.

The RFEF had received requests from La Liga, Liga F and the clubs themselves to postpone all professional matches in the area after the flash floods.

Several Copa del Rey matches, including Valencia's trip to Parla Escuela, had already been rescheduled.

The RFEF said a minute's silence will be observed during the weekend's games to show Spanish football's ""solidarity for those affected, especially the relatives of those who have died in the natural disaster""."

Three Forwards to Select for FPL Gameweek 10

Erling Haaland(£15.4m) – Bournemouth vs Manchester City

Erling Haaland successfully ended his mini goal drought by bagging an early goal which was enough to give the defending champions all three points. FPL contestants will hope the Norwegian can embark on a long goal-scoring streak from here.

On Saturday, Manchester City visit the Vitality Stadium to take on Bournemouth. The hosts will be in high spirits after defeating title contenders Arsenal 2-0. They will now look to take points off the defending champions as well.

The absence of Kevin De Bruyne, Jack Grealish, and Rodri Hernandez might be a blow to Haaland, who depends on his teammates for support. However, others like Bernardo Silva and Phil Foden will still lend a helping hand to the striker.

Nicolas Jackson (£7.9m) – Manchester United vs Chelsea

Nicolas Jackson’s stunning form has flown under the radar due to his teammate Cole Palmer’s exploits. The Senegalese forward has six goals and three assists in just nine games.

Enzo Maresca’s tactics have revitalized Jackson, who is proving capable of turning into an all-round striker. On Sunday, he will face an injury-ravaged Manchester United, whose defence easily wilts under pressure. The hosts have conceded 11 goals so far and might ship in more this week.

United’s midfield needs to be alert and stop Chelsea from using their attackers’ pace. Any failure to do so will only lead to more chances being provided for Jackson who might not miss them considering the form he is in.

Raul Jimenez (£5.7m) – Fulham vs Brentford – A Cost-Effective Option for Gameweek 10

Marco Silva has assembled a group of talented attacking players, and Raul Jimenez is a key part of this group. With four goals and an assist in just six starts, the Mexican is one of the most in-form strikers in the league. As a result, FPL players are desperate to get him into their team somehow.

The game against Brentford presents another golden opportunity for Jimenez to showcase his goal-scoring prowess. The Bees have a poor defensive record, which is likely to worsen this weekend.

Among the low-cost options, Jimenez is the right choice for this weekend as Danny Welbeck, another in-form option, faces a tough trip to Anfield. Meanwhile, Nottingham Forest’s Chris Wood might miss his side’s game due to an injury."

Philadelphia clearly had a great roster in 2024. It may not have resulted in a World Series title, but the Phillies did rack up 95 wins in the regular season. Philadelphia will have some question marks this winter and could lose some key pieces.

One player who will hit the open market this winter is All-Star reliever Jeff Hoffman. He shined for the Phillies in 2024 and had a 2.17 ERA across 68 appearances. It clearly was the best season of his nine-year big league career.

Now, he will hit free agency and FanSided's Zach Pressnell urged the New York Yankees to go out and sign him this winter.

""One of the more disappointing aspects of this 2024 Yankees team has been the bullpen,"" Pressnell said. ""Clay Holmes endured one of the worst second-half collapses in the entire American League, going from Holmes All-Star closer and one of the best relievers in baseball to an almost unusable arm by the time the postseason arrived. Luke Weaver stepped up huge in his place, providing a ton of clutch performances down the stretch for the Yankees, but the bullpen is still an area of need heading into free agency. Luckily, there are a ton of incredible relief arms available this winter, but the Yankees will likely be spending their big money trying to re-sign Soto.

""The bullpen task will be to find high-leverage options on a budget — guys like Jeff Hoffman of the Philadelphia Phillies. Hoffman has put up two consecutive sub-3.00 ERA seasons out of the Philly bullpen, with 2024 being the better of the two. He's not the team's closer, so his price tag wouldn't be as high as somebody like Tanner Scott, but he provides the stability that New York would need in the seventh, eighth or even ninth inning.""

Hoffman will be highly sought-after and the Yankees will be looking to reload after falling against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the World Series. This would be a logical fit if Hoffman decided to leave Philadelphia.

Instead, it’s tuberculosis that has once again become the world’s most deadly infectious disease. A World Health Organization report this week shows 10.8 million people became sick with TB last year (with 8.2 million people being newly diagnosed). Roughly 1.25 million of those people died because of the disease.

COVID deaths, meanwhile, have been significantly reduced thanks to vaccines and treatments, though it still claimed 320,000 lives last year.

“The fact that TB still kills and sickens so many people is an outrage, when we have the tools to prevent it, detect it and treat it,” WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a statement. “WHO urges all countries to make good on the concrete commitments they have made to expand the use of those tools, and to end TB.”

The number of new infections last year was the highest since the WHO began monitoring TB in 1995.

Tuberculosis largely affects people in 30 countries. More than half the global cases are found in India (26%), Indonesia (10%), China (6.8%), the Philippines (6.8%) and Pakistan (6.3%).

COVID, ironically, is partially responsible for the rise in TB cases. Disruptions from that virus hampered TB services across the globe, letting it increase. There’s also a strain of TB that has proven resistant to several drugs. Global funding for TB prevention has also decreased and funding for TB research only reached 20% of its target amount in 2022, the WHO said.

Tuberculosis is a contagious bacterial infection of the lungs that is normally spread through the air. Most tuberculosis infections are asymptomatic and not contagious. Active tuberculosis, however, which is characterized by cough, fever, decreased appetite, and weight loss, can be a very contagious and dangerous disease if left untreated, sometimes resulting in death."

I used to be studying the paper (The Age, 28/03/12) the opposite day and stumbled upon an article on weight reduction. It stated:

“Greater than 50 years of analysis confirms that diets have a failure charge of between95 to 98 p.c. That is proper – of each 100 individuals who weight loss plan, 98 of them will shortly restore any weight they do lose.

In keeping with the US Nationwide Institute of Well being Know-how evaluation convention, “(weight-loss) interventions produce quick time period losses adopted by weight achieve again, and no current therapies seem able to producing everlasting weight-loss.”.

That may be a damning analysis of weight loss plan plans! So if the place want to change our physique form, what can we do?

Plenty of the weight loss plan plans in existence deal with meals as a mere gas with none allowance for the pleasures that meals could convey. Meals is barely as an enter and the output it produces. This place implies that varied sorts of meals are recognized as nice and dangerous. This meals is nice gas. This meals is dangerous gas. This labelling of meals develops resistance. This meals is dangerous! These emotions of guilt that you just really feel as you devour these chips or donuts can impact the strategy our physique takes within the constituents of the meals. It implies that our physique isn’t in sympathy with the meals we eat. It could actually simply point out a destructive consequence. That’s placing on weight, being the consequence.

What if we proclaimed:.

“Meals is my buddy!”.

Now we are able to consider the well being and wellbeing that meals we devour promotes. This well being and wellbeing can embrace the pleasure meals brings us (how nice is a donut to devour?) together with diet. This enjoyment of consuming is usually peoples failure in weight-loss on account of the truth that it could really feel nice nonetheless the end result is miserable.

If we settle for there’s a divine pressure, life pressure, life power or supreme being, then it opens the likelihood to deal with your physique as greater than merely a tool. It allows us to utilize the magnificent legislation of vacation spot in creating the physique we need.The legislation of vacation spot informs us that “like brings in like”. For that purpose if we predict a meals is dangerous we will definitely draw within the issues that we’re afraid most! That’s, weight achieve. So while you subsequent sit right down to eat, consciously deal with the feeling you’ve gotten about this meals. It’s totally probably that the sensation is destructive.

If the meals is strictly what we might determine “dangerous” you’ll almost definitely have a grating, destructive sensation.

If the meals is strictly what we might name “good” the emotions probably extra favorable, however you may need resentment since you really feel you need to eat this sort of meals to maintain your physique.

It’s efficiently a struggle towards meals, when it must be recognized that meals is required for our wellbeing.

So when you have these type of sensations try:.

“Meals is my buddy!”.

“Designer Our bodies” is a program that makes use of the Regulation of Vacation spot to develop the physique we need. Our “Designer Physique”.

Designer Our bodies intends to fully alter our sensations and emotions about meals and our our bodies to develop the physique you need. Your “Designer Physique.”."

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:

Introducing tougher restrictions on sodium levels for packaged food could prevent thousands of deaths and save billions of dollars in health spending in Australia alone, a new study shows.

Mandating stringent targets for sodium levels in Australian packaged foods in line with World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations could prevent about 40,000 cardiovascular events and up to 3,000 deaths over a 10-year period, according to new research published on Thursday in the The Lancet Public Health.

Around 32,000 new cases of kidney disease could also be avoided and some $3.25 billion in health care costs saved over the population's lifespans.

Led by researchers at The George Institute for Global Health in collaboration with UNSW Sydney, Griffith University and Johns Hopkins University, the study is the first to project the long-term impacts of setting mandatory sodium reduction targets for processed foods, by comparing the Australian government's current voluntary benchmarks with the higher targets recommended by the WHO.

Excessive sodium intake is a major killer globally, contributing to cardiovascular disease (CVD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). In Australia, average daily consumption is almost double what is recommended by the WHO, with the majority coming from salt hidden in foods like processed meats, bread and bakery products, cereal and grain products, and dairy products.

Study author Professor Jason Wu, Head of Nutrition Science at The George Institute and a Professor at UNSW Medicine & Health's School of Population Health, said the analysis showed that setting sodium reduction levels higher than the current Australian targets, and making them mandatory, could bring significant health benefits and reduce the burden of CVD and CKD on the health care system.

""Our study projected enormous reductions in both cases and deaths from heart attacks, strokes and other heart conditions, as well as from kidney disease, within just a decade if the WHO reduction targets were mandated. Beyond 10 years, we also showed that this reduction in disease burden could generate billions of dollars in savings from health care costs related to these diseases,"" he said.

The WHO recommends reformulating food products to reduce sodium levels as part of its goal to decrease sodium consumption by 30% globally by 2025. This is also a component of the Australian federal government's Healthy Food Partnership (HFP), launched in 2015, which asks the food industry to reduce sodium levels across 27 food categories, among other measures to support healthy eating.

""Australia's sodium reformulation targets not only remain voluntary, but are also less rigorous than the WHO sodium benchmarks. We see industry consistently failing to meet voluntary targets and this weak regulatory system means Australia is missing an opportunity to protect its people from harmful effects of eating too much sodium,"" Prof. Wu added.

""Other countries such as Brazil, Mexico, Spain and Malaysia have adopted mandatory sodium limits, so it can be done. We have now shown that if Australia adopted these more effective benchmarks and made them compulsory, it could help relieve the strain on our health care system over the next few decades.""

Griffith University's Dr. Leopold Aminde from the School of Medicine and Dentistry said the research exemplifies the reasons why Australia must now move away from a voluntary approach to mandating sodium thresholds for packaged foods.

""Curtailing excessive sodium consumption has the ability to prevent thousands of deaths and cases of cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease, coupled with the added economic cost-saving benefits for Australia's health system,"" Dr. Aminde said.

""Our analysis shows these benefits could be three-to-four times greater when stringent sodium thresholds, such as those proposed by the WHO, are mandated compared to the existing voluntary targets.""

Dr. Luz Maria De Regil, Head of the Multisectoral Actions in Food Systems unit, Department of Nutrition and Food Safety at the WHO said, ""With only voluntary measures in place to reduce sodium in the food supply, Australia may not offer to all its population adequate protection from heart attack, stroke, and other health problems.

""The WHO is calling on all countries to implement our 'best buy' interventions for sodium reduction, and on governments to mandate that manufacturers implement the WHO benchmarks for sodium content in food.""

Scientists from the University of Nottingham have developed a new method of genetic analysis, which extracts more precise data than previously used methods when looking at DNA, and will improve our understanding of the genetic basis of rare and complex diseases.

The findings of the study, which are published in Physiological Genomics, explain a new method of analyzing genetics, which determines the extent to which genes are involved in phenotype formation.

The previously used method extracted information using averages from different datasets, meaning that it had limitations in terms of the type of information it could provide, and what scientists could learn from it.

The study was led by Dr. Cyril Rauch, an Associate Professor in Physical and Mathematical Veterinary Medicine and Science at the University of Nottingham.

Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) provide a method to map genotypes—the genetic makeup of an organism, and phenotypes—observational traits such as height or hair color. This helps scientists to understand biology, and in turn, how to treat certain diseases.

Although genomic technologies have advanced quickly, the statistical models used to analyze genotype and phenotype association are based on works developed by scientist R. A Fisher more than 100 years ago. However, there is an ongoing debate in the scientific community over whether this method has reached its limit for truly understanding the genetic basis of rare and complex traits—such as rare diseases.

As the UK wants to capitalize on the success of gene editing technologies, this is something that needs urgently addressing since there can only be useful editing technologies in the cases of rare and complex traits, if precise genotype-phenotype mapping information is available.

In this context, new and more accurate statistical methods maximizing the investigative power of biological or medical data are needed to help define gene targets and future treatments precisely.

Inspired by physics theory, an interdisciplinary team of researchers at the University of Nottingham have dedicated time over the past few years to rethink and change the mathematical foundations of classic GWA methods, so they can maximize the investigative power of genotype/phenotype datasets.

This has resulted in a new method called Genomic Informational Theory (GIFT) that has now been applied successfully to a range of datasets. By removing the informational barrier linked to dataset categories, the team have demonstrated that it is possible to extract more information using GIFT than the previously used GWAS.

Dr. Rauch says, ""One way to represent the difference in the investigative or informational powers of GIFT relative to GWASs is to use an analogy with the magnification power of microscopes. Our results show that comparing the informational (resolution) powers of GIFT relative to GWASs is like comparing an electron microscope (GIFT) to a light microscope (GWASs).

""With increased informational power, GIFT can be applied to relatively large datasets to extract further information and/or to small datasets to extract novel information where GWASs were unable to do so previously. GIFT is particularly well suited for applications in fields were building datasets is difficult, for example, rare diseases.""

Scientific American studies indicate that reaching for a phone first thing in the morning may set the brain up for distraction, priming it for reactive thinking throughout the day. Lauren Sanchez told People that she and her fiance, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, who also speaks out about the most important reason humans need to go to space, have a morning routine that excludes phones altogether. In a recent interview with People, Sanchez shared how this tech-free rule helps the couple stay connected and start their day with intention.

""I make myself a cup of coffee. I make Jeff a cup of coffee, and we kind of have this magic moment where it's just us talking,"" Sanchez revealed. She explained that mornings are quiet and undistracted, noting, ""The kids haven't woken up yet. And we don't get on our phones. That's one of the rules."" According to Sanchez, this daily routine is something they strictly adhere to, especially since it allows them to connect before the day's busyness takes over. ""He definitely made that rule,"" she added, sharing how Bezos initiated the no-phone practice."

The co-chair of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s transition team promoted the debunked theory that vaccines cause autism in a CNN interview Wednesday. He also said Trump ally Robert F. Kennedy Jr., hopes to get “data” through a Trump administration to have vaccines pulled “off the market.”

Howard Lutnick, the billionaire CEO of investment bank Cantor Fitzgerald and a longtime friend of Trump’s, told the network’s Kaitlan Collins that vaccines are “not proven” to be safe. Lutnick said he’d recently been schooled on vaccines by Kennedy, the failed independent presidential candidate and anti-vaxxer who has endorsed Trump.

Kennedy has said he would have significant influence over public health policy if Trump wins the White House.

“So, I spent two-and-a-half hours this week with Bobby Kennedy Jr., and it was the most extraordinary thing. Because, let’s face it, we’ve all heard on the news all sorts of sort of snarky comments about him,” Lutnick told Collins.

Recounting his conversation with Kennedy, Lutnick went on to link autism to the growth of vaccines — a discredited idea that dates back to a retracted study from 1998 — before Collins interrupted to remind viewers Lutnick is not a scientist.

“Hang on,” the anchor said. “OK, neither of us are doctors. Vaccines are safe.”

“Why do you think vaccines are safe? There’s no product liability anymore. They’re not proven,” Lutnick said.

“Because they’re proven. Kids get them and they’re fine,” Collins said.

“Why do you think they’re fine?” Lutnick responded.

A Trump spokesperson did not immediately respond Thursday morning when asked if the campaign stood by Lutnick’s comments.

Trump transition co-chair Howard Lutnick — in charge of helping staff the gov if he wins — says he had a 2.5 hour meeting with RFK Jr. who talked about pulling (safe and proven) vaccines from the market. Lutnick says RFK will not be in charge of HHS, despite what RFK said. pic.twitter.com/K6wFo6EwqP — Kaitlan Collins (@kaitlancollins) October 31, 2024

Lutnick went on to say that Kennedy wants vaccines pulled off the market ― and that Kennedy hopes a Trump administration could get him the data to accomplish that.

“He wants the data so he can say, ‘These things are unsafe,’” Lutnick said. “He says, ‘If you give me the data, all I want is the data, and I’ll take on the data and show that it’s not safe. And if you pull the product liability, the companies will yank these vaccines right off ― off of the market.’ So that’s his point.”

The former president himself has long voiced skepticism of vaccines and has promised to cut funding for schools that require them, playing into anti-vax conspiracy theories that have gone mainstream in the Republican Party. (All states have variations of laws requiring certain vaccines.)

Trump also engaged in some anti-vax banter with Kennedy during a July phone call captured in a leaked video.

“When you feed a baby, Bobby, a vaccination that is like 38 different vaccines, and it looks like it’s fit for a horse, not a 10-pound or 20-pound baby, it looks like you should be giving a horse this thing,” Trump said on the call.

After Kennedy dropped out of the race and endorsed Trump, the former president gave him a slot on his transition team.

Kennedy told supporters earlier this week that Trump had promised to give him “control” over key public health agencies like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

“The key that I think I’m — you know, that President Trump has promised me is — is control of the public health agencies,” Kennedy said in a livestream, video of which CNN obtained. He cited the Department of Health and Human Services, the Food and Drug Administration and the National Institutes of Health, among others.

Jakarta is at all times included within the variety of articles which discusses counterfeit medication. Regardless of the allegations and totally different accusations, Indonesia continues to disregard and stays mute to the problems. As an alternative, the federal government continues to strengthen their very own penalties and rules by imposing capital punishment for people caught smuggling and importing unlawful and substandard medication.

Only in the near past, nevertheless, the Ministry of Well being suspended one of many main non-profit organizations that fight the towering variety of counterfeit circumstances reported to function within the archipelago’s capital.

The Peterson Group, after helping the native police in an ambush operation towards a small enterprise enterprise in Menteng, has then posted an article entitled, “WHO to Reward Whistleblowers on Drug Counterfeiting” final September 25, 2015. The article states that there have been 4,000 packages of generic Cialis and 200 packing containers of Viagra confiscated together with three counterfeiting machines, soiled syringes, and three pails of chalk. The report garnered consideration added with complaints and frustration towards Indonesia’s native authorities unit. It quickly escalated to the well being ministry. After verifying the astounding numbers from the native authorities and from the World Well being Group (WHO) a right away assembly was held with representatives of The Peterson Group. The NGO then admitted to their fault of misinformation and instantly accepted one month of suspension from any actions regarding counterfeiting within the nation.

WHO additionally launched the precise figures behind the operation. Mark Strenson, WHO spokesperson, said, “We apologize for the misinformation which undoubtly brought on panic amongst our involved residents. It was additionally an overlook in our half. As an alternative of 4,000 Counterfeited Cialis, there have been precisely 364 packages present in our operation in Menteng, Each the native authorities and the whistleblowers confirmed these. We at the moment are implementing keener instigation of transparency to keep away from future misconceptions”.

The Peterson Group has then confronted totally different backlashes from each netizens and personal people. Criticisms embrace claims of fraud. Different folks consider it was only a easy mistake of misinformation.

Karl Kirkson, TPG spokesperson in Jakarta then issued an apology speech saying, “The corporate is now reflecting on our actions. We understand the load of affect we’re holding amongst folks combating the identical trigger that now we have. We have now completely been reckless in our phrases and have been significantly oblivious on the burden and hazard it may well result in when folks begin studying our article.

Your liver, which is the largest internal organ in your body, is responsible for a lot. It regulates blood clotting, removes toxins like alcohol from your bloodstream, helps in the production of bile and so much more.

But your liver can get damaged and have reduced functioning due to illness or lifestyle habits. In fact, liver disease is fairly common, affecting 4.5 million adults in the United States.

Liver disease is a very broad term that encompasses many different conditions that impair normal liver function, according to Dr. Douglas Weine, a gastroenterologist at Hackensack Meridian Health Center. Liver conditions include non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, hepatitis or even cancer.

Sometimes, these symptoms will happen immediately, but not always.

“Signs and symptoms of liver disease do not typically present until there is significant liver damage,” said Dr. Bubu Banini, a hepatologist and assistant professor at Yale School of Medicine.

So, how do you know when something is wrong with your liver? And how can you figure out what it is? We spoke to hepatologists about the five most common warning signs of liver disease and what to do if you spot these issues:

1. Yellowing of the skin or eyes

“A subtle sign of liver disease is yellowing of the white of the eyes or skin, known as jaundice,” Banini said.

This happens when there’s excess bilirubin, a pigment that is created during the natural breakdown of red blood cells in the body. Bilirubin is typically processed by the liver and removed from the body, but too much of it can cause jaundice and indicate liver issues.

While high levels of bilirubin aren’t always a huge issue for adults, the underlying issue causing it can be, which is why it’s crucial to talk to your doctor if you notice any yellowing of the skin or eyes.

2. Dark urine — even if you’re hydrated

Dark urine on its own typically doesn’t concern people. Usually, it’s an indicator that you need to drink some extra fluids.

But it is also typical for people with liver conditions to excrete dark urine, Weine said. This is due to the buildup of bilirubin, which can turn urine into a dark orange, brown or amber color. If you’re drinking normally and still noticing issues with urine color, it could be a sign that something else is going on.

3. Confusion

We all forget things from time to time, but major changes to your mental state shouldn’t be ignored. They could be a sign of liver problems or a number of other underlying issues. If you experience confusion or other mind-altering issues, seek help right away.

“A person who is otherwise healthy can develop acute liver failure that could manifest as changes in mental state or personality such as disorientation, confusion or sleepiness,” Banini said.

4. Swelling in the legs, ankles or the abdomen

You may not associate this issue with liver problems, but swelling in your legs and feet could potentially indicate something is wrong, Weine said. This is particularly true when you’re experiencing cirrhosis, which is the scarring of the liver.

Cirrhosis slows blood flow through the liver and increases pressure in the vein that brings blood through the organ, according to the Mayo Clinic. The pressure in this vein, known as a portal vein, “can cause fluid to accumulate in the legs, called edema, and in the abdomen, called ascites,” the Mayo Clinic stated, noting that “edema and ascites also may happen if the liver can’t make enough of certain blood proteins, such as albumin.”

5. Bruising and bleeding easily

People with liver damage may bruise or bleed easily when injured, Weine said. This happens because the liver produces proteins that the blood needs to clot, so when the liver is not functioning well, you are easily prone to bleeding.

What to do if you believe you have liver damage

Liver issues aren’t something to dismiss. Heavy or moderate alcohol use, Type 2 diabetes, using shared needles, contact with toxins or a family history of liver disease are all risk factors for liver damage.

If you believe you have any liver damage symptoms, it’s important to discuss this with your provider. Other symptoms include stool changes, exhaustion, appetite changes and more."
1027,2024-10-27 07:00:27,The Truth About Cinnamon's Health Benefits And Risks,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-health-benefits-and-risks-of-eating-cinnamon-according-to-experts-goog_l_671a7897e4b07a680746dec3,Health,"Cavan Images / Dorene Hookey via Getty Images Research shows that cinnamon can be good for your health.

Like the latest love interest of Taylor Swift, who’s poised for superstardom, cinnamon is the standout spice of the fall. Rising above nutmeg, cloves and ginger in a pumpkin spice blend, it promises more than just great flavor and an irresistible aroma. Research is showing that it can be good for your health, too.

Noting that current studies are not yet fully conclusive, Dr. Michael L. Dansinger, an internist and professor at Tufts University School of Medicine, said that even without long-term, definitive results, “There are enough favorable studies that together suggest that about 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon per day may slightly improve blood sugar, insulin resistance, blood pressure, cholesterol levels and inflammation, compared to placebos.” The spice has already shown positive possibilities for some people with health conditions, including Type 2 diabetes or obesity.

Registered dietitian Toby Smithson noted that cinnamon contains promising health benefits but also requires caution. “The good news is that cinnamon contains bioactive ingredients, including antioxidants, and some studies have shown health benefits to cholesterol and triglyceride levels, blood pressure and modest improvements in post-meal blood sugar spikes and fasting blood sugar levels. But studies looking at lowering A1C, a measure of average blood sugar levels, have been inconclusive so far,” Smithson explained.

Julia Zumpano, a registered dietitian from the Center for Human Nutrition at the Cleveland Clinic, said, “Although we do know the benefits of cinnamon are real, the exact dosages have not yet been established since more research is needed.” But she also added, “Use cinnamon as often as you can, as a spice, to reap the benefits.”

There are different kinds of cinnamon, so shop with care.

If you aim to boost your cinnamon IQ, be aware that there are different types. The two most popular are Ceylon cinnamon from Sri Lanka and Cassia, a less-expensive variety that originated in Southern China but is now grown across many regions of Eastern and Southern Asia. The type of cinnamon you choose makes a difference, Smithson said. “The European Food Agency has set the daily intake limit for Cassia cinnamon at 1/2 teaspoon per day because of the presence of a compound called coumarin,” he added. “Cassia cinnamon has about 250 times the coumarin as Ceylon, and coumarin is suspected of causing liver damage at high doses.” Because of these cautions, Smithson recommended using the Ceylon variety.

Another caution exists for Vietnamese cinnamon, noted registered dietitian nutritionist Amanda Frankeny. “Consumer Labs, a company that independently tests the quality of health and nutrition products, found that the Simply Organic Vietnamese Cinnamon contained 6.2 milligrams of coumarin per gram,” she said. “This suggests that at-risk populations may want to limit their consumption of this brand.”

How should you consume cinnamon?

“Don’t be fooled into thinking that cinnamon rolls or cinnamon supplements are a good treatment for diabetes or a good way to prevent health problems,” Dansinger said. “The best way to use cinnamon is to incorporate it into a healthy eating plan. Many health experts agree that an overall healthy eating and lifestyle strategy is crucially important for maintaining health and longevity, and for minimizing the risk of heart disease, stroke, Type 2 diabetes, cancers, dementia and many other common health problems.”

Dansinger offered this caution if you hope to get your cinnamon intake through supplements. “Cinnamon capsules are not regulated, and some studies have found that different brands of cinnamon capsules vary in terms of the quality of their cinnamon content,” he said.

Zumpano noted, “If you’d like to use cinnamon as a supplement in capsule form, speak to your health care provider or a registered dietitian to help you find a dose that is right for you. Be cautious with cinnamon supplements, and be sure they are third-party tested.” She suggested reviewing brand data on independent, third-party testing sites like ConsumerLab.com, NSF or Fullscript.

How to add more cinnamon to your diet.

Amy Gorin, a registered dietitian nutritionist, adds cinnamon to coffee, desserts and soup. And she highlights another benefit of the spice: “Surprisingly, cinnamon boasts satiating fiber. Just one teaspoon of cinnamon offers more than a gram of fiber.”

And it’s important to remember that the delicious taste of cinnamon may be a good stand-in for less-healthy choices, Chelsey Amer, a registered dietitian nutritionist, said. “Adding cinnamon to your meals can add flavor, without added sugar, which can help you reduce your overall sugar intake,” Amer added.

Cinnamon can be sprinkled on top of oatmeal or in morning coffee, too. “I also like to add cinnamon to the batter of any of my breakfast baked goods I’m making, like pancakes and waffles,” Michael C. Williams, a registered dietitian, said. “It adds warm flavor to savory recipes, too, so try pairing it with spices like cloves, cardamom and nutmeg. Cinnamon also pairs well with different ingredients like apples, apricots, blueberries, pears, bananas, almonds and chicken.”

annabogush via Getty Images Eating too much cinnamon may lead to liver damage, mouth sores and low blood sugar.

As always, don’t overdo it.

As great as all this sounds, too much of a good thing, even with cinnamon, can be a bad idea. “Cinnamon could potentially be toxic in high amounts, for example, if you took as much as three teaspoons daily,” Dansinger said.

“The optimal amount of cinnamon to consume for health benefits can vary depending on factors, including your health condition, tolerance and the specific benefits being sought,” according to Carissa Galloway, a registered dietitian nutritionist. She added, “It’s important to note that while cinnamon does offer potential health benefits, consuming excessive amounts can also have adverse effects, especially if you’re taking certain medications or have underlying health conditions.”

Williams said having too much cinnamon could result in liver damage, mouth sores and low blood sugar. He added, “And as with any powdery substance, if cinnamon is inhaled, it can lead to respiratory issues like coughing, sneezing and difficulty breathing.”

Check your prescriptions before increasing cinnamon intake, experts advised. “Coumarin in cinnamon interacts with blood thinning medications, such as Warfarin and Coumadin, which prevents blood clots and improves circulation,” Frankeny said.

Gorin added: “Remember that there can be too much of a good thing and that balance is important. So make sure to cook with a variety of health-helping spices and herbs. There are so many, including turmeric and ginger.”

But still, it’s fun to spice it up.

While current research is trending positive, there is still more work to do. “Scientists are asking for more high-quality, long-term randomized control trials, the gold standard and most challenging research, to confirm any of these promising findings with cinnamon,” Frankeny said.

And although it’s not a panacea, there are still many positive benefits to adding some cinnamon to your life. Dansinger offered this advice: “Embrace the full glory of spices such as cinnamon to add variety and pizazz to your healthy meals.”

Just hold off on considering the spice “a silver bullet” or using it to replace doctor-prescribed treatments because more research still needs to be done on the spice, Sharon Palmer, a registered dietitian nutritionist, said. However, she added, “do consider it a part of your healthy, disease-protective lifestyle.”"

She told GRAMMY.com: ""I feel the most connected to this album out of all my albums, and very much for those reasons. It reflects me in some way. Obviously with covers, we don’t write them, we sing them, but they’re connected to my family traditions.

""My grandmother used to love 'The Christmas Song' and I remember her saying, ‘The man with the satin voice,’ about Nat King Cole, so that inspired me to do that song. And 'Drummer Boy,' the way we approached it I’m showing you my roots of where I came from musically.

""So in this album, whether it’s musically or lyrically, my story shows up. Even with 'O Holy Night,' I would make a different arrangement every year and pass it out to my family, so that had to be on there. But this year, I get to give my family a whole album instead of just one song.""

The 0-7-2 Sharks lost their ninth-straight to start this season, a 7-3 loss to the Vegas Golden Knights.

They’re the first team in NHL history to start back-to-back seasons with nine straight losses.

“It’s embarrassing,” Warsofsky said. “Truly embarrassing.”

Last year’s Sharks started 0-10-1.

Game 10 and 11 is where San Jose really lost the plot last season, dropping back-to-back 10-spots, 10-1 versus the Vancouver Canucks, then 10-2 against the Pittsburgh Penguins.

Game 10 for the Sharks this year is Monday in Utah.

“Tomorrow is a new day. We’re going to get back at it. We’re going to find ways to improve, and we’re going to get our first win in Utah,” alternate captain Mario Ferraro said defiantly.

The San Jose locker room, understandably so, keeps saying that they don’t want to talk about last season. But they’re now joined in infamy with last season’s Sharks.

They want to change the conversation — and good news, they’ve got 73 games to change it. Or bad news, there’s 73 games left to go this year.

After the game, Ferraro spoke about playing against Tomas Hertl for the first time.

Warsofsky addressed dropping Danil Gushchin to the fourth line.

Also, Vitek Vanecek discussed his gaffe that led to William Karlsson’s back-breaking goal.

Mario Ferraro

Ferraro, on how this season’s poor San Jose Sharks’ start compares to past seasons’:

I don’t know. That’s hard to talk about right now. Obviously, it’s been a tough start for us. I don’t want to talk about last year. Last year is in the past, last couple years, whatever. This a new year.

Ferraro, on seeing Tomas Hertl on the other side:

He’s a talented player, like I said to you earlier this morning, he’s meant a lot to me and my career. He’s had that effect on a lot of guys. So I’m happy he’s doing well. He obviously had a good game tonight, and I hope he continues to do well this season. He deserves it.

Ferraro, on where San Jose Sharks go from here:

Tomorrow is a new day. We’re going to get back at it. We’re going to find ways to improve, and we’re going to get our first win in Utah."

Topuria (16-0) fired in a right hand which dazed Holloway before following up with a powerful left hook that dropped the 32-year-old in the third round.

Topuria pounced on Holloway immediately for a ground-and-pound finish before referee Mark Goddard stopped the bout at the 1:34 mark of the third round.

""To beat a legend like Max Holloway, I don't know what to say,"" Topuria said.

""He's been a great example for the generation. I hope I'm going to be a small example he has been for me for the new generation.""

Topuria said he knew immediately with his initial power punch that the victory was within his grasp.

""I caught him with the right hand, I felt it,"" Topuria said. ""I saw it in his face. You don't see that often in Max Holloway.""

During the first round, Topuria did some early damage with leg kicks to Holloway's lead leg.

Both fighters' boxing skills were on display in the second round, with Holloway landing several big shots but it was Topuria's leg kicks that seemingly continued to weaken Holloway.

Then came his two big punches in the third.

""He just landed a shot and I guess it hurt much more than I thought it did,"" said Holloway, who fell to 26-8.

""I felt great until he did it. No excuses. I felt great, I had a great camp, no injuries. I went out there, did my thing. He was just a better man.""

It was Topuria's first title defence since capturing the belt with a second-round technical knockout of Alexander Volkanovski at UFC 298 in February earlier this year.

Topuria's back-to-back victories over Holloway and Volkanovski make a case for him to be named fighter of the year.

Volkanovski was in attendance and Topuria said he would honour him with a rematch.

""You deserve that, you're the man,"" Topuria told Volkanovski.

In the co-main event, No 13 Khamzat Chimaev (14-0) stopped No 3 Robert Whitaker (27-8) with a first-round submission just 3:34 into the fight, after taking him down and administering a wicked face crank.

""I'm going for the belt!"" Chimaev said after his dominating win.

""I love you brother, you're a legend,"" the Russian told Whitaker during his post-fight interview.

I am Canadian but USA doesn’t require voter Id so figured I would drive across the border and vote Kind regards pic.twitter.com/HfcNdauCG7 — Wizard Of SoHo (🍷,🍷) (@wizardofsoho) October 28, 2024

Verdict: False

The photo was edited from a ballot posted by a U.S. voter.

Fact Check:

President Joe Biden is receiving backlash for claiming that Trump supporters are “garbage” in a Zoom call with Voto Latino, Fox News reported. Vice President Kamala Harris responded to the comment by expressing her disagreement and saying she would not criticize someone for who they vote for, according to the outlet.

A post shared on X, formerly known as Twitter, purportedly shows a Canadian citizen voting in the U.S. election. The photo shows a ballot with the bubble for Trump filled in, the caption claims the poster voted and is not a U.S. citizen.

The caption reads, “I am Canadian but USA doesn’t require voter Id so figured I would drive across the border and vote. Kind regards.”

The claim is inaccurate. The image dates back to Oct. 13 when a different social media user posted the image without any reference to the voter being a non-citizen. The new X post edited the image so her thumb would be cropped out.

Muñoz reposted a tweet that called out users for using the photo of the ballot to claim they voted in the election.

How does it work?,https://www.clickondetroit.com/news/michigan/2024/10/31/is-split-ticket-voting-allowed-in-michigan-elections-how-does-it-work/,Politics,"SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA - JUNE 07: A voter fills out his ballot in a polling station at San Francisco City Hall on June 07, 2022 in San Francisco. California. Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)

Election Day is getting closer and closer for Michigan voters, though voting is already well underway with absentee and early voting.

The voting process in Michigan is fairly straightforward, but there is some confusion about when voters can vote a “split ticket,” which means voting for candidates in more than one political party.

The simplest explanation:

Michiganders cannot vote a split ticket in August primary elections. Voters must choose one political party and vote for candidates within that party only during a primary election, which is called voting a “straight ticket.”

In November general elections, however, Michigan voters have a bit more freedom to move around on the ballot. Michigan voters are allowed to select candidates from different parties for different races during the general election -- they are not required to vote only for candidates in a specific party.

Below is a more in-depth explanation of the different voting styles and when they’re allowed, or not allowed, in Michigan elections.

---> Michigan 2024 election: Early voting, mail in voting dates and FAQ

Voting straight ticket

In Michigan primary elections, voters are required to vote a straight ticket. A voter selects a party, which doesn’t have to match their party affiliation on file, and vote for their preferred candidates within that party. The point of a primary election is to narrow down which candidate from that party will run for that office in the November general election.

To vote a straight ticket, the voter selects which party they intend to vote within. If a person voting in a Michigan primary chooses to vote within the Republican Party only, but then fills in a bubble for a Democratic candidate for a race, their ballot becomes invalid. In Michigan primaries, voters are restricted to vote within one party only, or else their ballot is deemed invalid and will not count.

The situation is different for November general elections.

Michiganders can opt to vote straight ticket during a November general election, but they are not obligated to only vote within that party, as they are during primary elections.

In a general election, if a Michigan voter chooses to vote straight ticket for the Democratic Party, for example, all Democratic candidates in every race on that ballot will be indirectly selected. The voter would not have to select a candidate for each individual race; the Democratic candidates would automatically be recognized as being chosen.

If that voter decides to vote straight ticket for the Democratic Party and also fills in a bubble next to a preferred Democratic candidate, the vote for that candidate will only count once. There would not be two votes for that candidate.

If voting straight ticket, voters need to be aware of non-partisan races and proposals that are also on the ballot. For each of these races, voters will need to make a selection separately. If separate selections are made, and there are no candidates from the straight ticket party selection running in that race, no candidate will be chosen for that race.

In Michigan general elections, voters can choose the straight ticket option, but also then select a candidate from a different party for whatever race or races they choose. This is called voting split ticket.

Voting split ticket

Michigan voters are allowed to split their ticket when voting in November general elections.

Voting split ticket means to make a straight party ticket selection, but then vote for a candidate from a different party for one or multiple races.

For example: A voter could select the option to vote straight ticket for the Republican Party, which would indirectly select the Republican candidate or candidates for each race in which a Republican candidate is running. The voter is allowed to vote for a candidate from a different party in addition to their straight party ticket selection, should they choose to. If the voter wishes to select a Democratic candidate instead of a Republican candidate for a specific race or races, the voter can fill in the bubble next to the Democratic candidate’s name. Doing so would override their Republican straight ticket selection for whatever race they do this for.

So, a voter can override their straight ticket selection for a specific race or races if they individually select a candidate outside of that party.

Only the maximum number of candidates can be chosen for each race, regardless of their party. Voters cannot select more than the maximum number of candidates for a given race. The ballot will explicitly identify how many candidates can be chosen for a given race.

Voting mixed ticket

Michigan voters are not required to make a straight ticket selection when voting in general elections. Voters can select each preferred candidate for each individual race, regardless of the candidates’ party affiliation. This is called voting mixed ticket.

A voter could, in theory, vote for a Republican candidate in one race, a Democratic candidate in the next race, and a Green Party candidate in the following race without any repercussions regarding the ballot’s validity. Voters are allowed to choose any candidate for any race, so long as they only select the maximum number of candidates allowed to be selected for that race.

Voters cannot select more than the maximum number of candidates for a given race. The ballot will explicitly identify how many candidates can be chosen for a given race.

Write-in voting

If a voter wishes to vote for a candidate who is not on the ballot, they can do so using the “write-in” option.

In the primary election, a Michigan voter can select to write in a candidate’s name and select them as their preferred candidate within their party selection. There are a number of rules that must be followed in order for a write-in option to count in the primary election.

In a general election, a Michigan voter can choose to write in the name of a candidate instead of voting for someone already on the ballot, regardless of the candidate’s party affiliation. The voter must fill in the bubble next to the write-in option and then write the name of their preferred candidate in order for that vote to count. If the bubble is not filled in, any text that is written in will not be considered valid.

1031,2024-10-31 14:14:02,CA lawmakers slam ‘ivory tower’ state energy ‘politburo’ as estimated 65-cent gas price hike looms,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ca-lawmakers-slam-ivory-tower-state-energy-politburo-estimated-65-cent-gas-price-hike-looms,Politics,"A top California Republican lambasted the prospect of a 65-cent-per-gallon hike in gas prices next month, accusing the state’s energy resources board of being wealthy and out of touch with the working class.

Senate Minority Leader Brian Jones of San Diego cited an analysis reported in the Ventura County Star that new regulations up for a vote Nov. 8 will lead to the near-two-thirds-of-a-dollar hike.

""A governor who lives in idyllic Marin County, a millionaire CARB executive officer, and a Democrat-exclusive board filled with wealthy politicians, former politicians, and academics have set themselves up as judge, jury, and executioner,"" Jones said.

The Republican added it seems the board members are looking down from their ""ivory tower"" at the ""struggling middle class and working poor.""

SUNUNU NAMES TWO GOVERNORS ALL THE OTHERS HATE

""Their ‘we know what's best for you’ attitude is infuriating for hardworking Californians who are already scraping by just to fill their tanks at current prices, let alone after this new hike.""

CARB – the California Air Resources Board – itself reportedly estimated the hike would come out to be 47 cents.

The regulations include stricter limits on carbon intensity in fuel, the paper said.

California already has the highest combined (local-state-federal) gas tax in the nation, at 87 cents, followed by Pennsylvania and Illinois at about 78 cents, according to a 2020 analysis by the American Petroleum Institute.

Jones quipped that he isn’t sure whether it is ""arrogance, ignorance or both that the CARB politburo seems to be operating under"" in regard to a major jump in already-elevated gas prices.

TOP REPUBLICAN DEMANDS ANSWERS FROM NEWSOM, FEDS OVER WRONGFUL MEDICAID PAYMENTS TO CERTAIN CA IMMIGRANTS

Ten of the 16 members are ""considerably wealthier"" than the average Californian, and Chairman Steven Cliff, who was also a Biden NHTSA appointee, is a millionaire, according to public records cited by the lawmaker.

Gov. Gavin Newsom, who appointed several of the members of CARB’s board, was recently asked whether he will require CARB to disclose the true cost of the gas hike.

""You’re the boss,"" a reporter said. ""I’m not the dictator,"" Newsom replied.

""I think you heard exactly what I said -- I think it’s important to be transparent.""

Additionally, state Sen. Rosilicie Ochoa Bogh, R-San Bernardino, and Assemblyman Greg Wallis, R-Riverside, urged CARB chair Liane Randolph to postpone its Nov. 8 vote until costs can be officially calculated.

The lawmakers noted that Californians pay an average $1.50 more per gallon than the Lower 48 average.

Meanwhile, state Sen. Henry Stern, D-Malibu, has defended CARB. In one exchange, he told a critic that he sits as the Senate’s ex-officio appointee on the board, and that innovation and competition drive down costs.

""It’s wrong to assume there will be a downstream impact of oil’s compliance with LCFS (though they’ve spent millions propagandizing this warning). Electric vehicles used to be expensive. Now they’re mainstream. Renewable diesel used to be pricey. Now it’s competing with petroleum diesel. That’s why they really want to end LCFS and the regulators who enforce it,"" Stern wrote on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter.

Stern recently told KCRA that CARB is ""not necessarily good at communicating this to the public. And that's where folks like me come in and cut through it a bit.""

Amid the back-and-forth, two major oil companies reportedly may be closing refineries in California.

Last week, Phillips66 announced it would shutter a refinery in Los Angeles, according to OilPrice.com. Now, Valero is reportedly citing regulatory pressures from the Golden State government and leaving ""all options on the table,"" according to the energy news site.

The frustration with CARB's work extends beyond Republican circles. Democratic Assembly member Wendy Carrillo of Los Angeles sharply criticized the board for its lack of transparency, echoing concerns raised by an NBC reporter who was repeatedly denied interview requests.

""When I chaired the Assembly Budget Committee on State Administration, one of my biggest frustrations were [agencies] and departments asking for funding but weren’t prepared [with] data and lacked transparency at public hearings – a direct result of laws ceding legislative oversight to administration,"" Carrillo said.

CARB did not respond to a request for comment."

""From its onset, the Biden-Harris administration promised to ‘bring transparency and truth back to government,’ per then-White House press secretary Jen Psaki,"" the 26-page report from Protect the Public’s Trust (PPT) states.

""Psaki also claimed that President Joe Biden ‘is committed to ensuring we have the most ethically vigorous administration in history.’ However, the administration and its executive branch agencies have often failed to live up to these high ideals, and the myth of a scandal-free administration is just that: a myth.""

The report outlines alleged ethics violations throughout the Biden administration from the White House, Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Department of Interior, Department of Energy, Environmental Protection Agency, Department of Commerce, State Department and other various complaints.

WHITE HOUSE STYMIED BIPARTISAN SUPPORT FOR PRESIDENTIAL ETHICS BILL, SAYS TOP HOUSE DEM

In the Biden White House, the report outlines alleged ethics issues with the Office of White House Counsel (WHCO) and the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), including allegations that Biden’s White House lawyers were acting as his personal attorneys amid the investigation into mishandling of classified documents.

The report also suggests that White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre has violated the Hatch Act, along with White House deputy press secretary Andrew Bates, and raises concerns about former press secretary Psaki's ""apparent conflict of interest while looking to leave federal service for a high-salary television job.""

DEMS IN HOT SEAT FOR ALLEGED ETHICS VIOLATIONS OVER ALITO RECUSAL DEMANDS

In the portion of the report that discusses President Biden's HHS, the report says ""no agency has lost so much credibility during the Biden-Harris administration"" as HHS.

""As it took the reins amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the Biden-Harris HHS disregarded ethical and scientific integrity principles as it issued farreaching recommendations governing nearly every aspect of Americans’ lives,"" the report states. ""PPT exposed a number of potential violations and filed several complaints against appointees in the department and its component agencies to help preserve what little remains of the public’s trust.""

The report outlines how Biden's Department of Interior (DOI) ""has a record of cutting ethical corners in favor of special interest policies"" and that the Department of Energy has given DOI a ""run for its money"" with its own questionable ethics decisions.

""Ethics issues in the Biden-Harris administration didn’t end with Hunter Biden and the president’s family,"" Michael Chamberlain, Director of Protect the Public’s Trust, told Fox News Digital. ""Despite their claims to be the most ethical in history, we’ve documented possible ethics violations in most of the Cabinet-level agencies, including confirmed Hatch Act violations, conflicts of interest, and all the hazards that come with having a revolving door between official D.C. and well-connected activist groups.""

""While others have found similar Biden-Harris breaches, they are not the groups and media outlets that were so enthusiastic about uncovering problems in the last administration. Just because the public hasn’t heard much about these in the legacy media, we caution everyone to beware of future attempts to paint this as a ‘scandal-free’ administration,"" he added.

CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP

The report concludes by saying many of their documented complaints have led to ""investigations by Inspectors General, the Office of Special Counsel or other investigative bodies, or prompting letters from Congressional committees.""

""As is often the case when it comes to government, sunlight is the best disinfectant,"" the report concluded. ""The light we have shone on these incidents may be useful when revisionist historians begin twisting their tales in the coming years, to help expose the myth of a ‘scandal-free’ administration as just that: a myth.""

1031,2024-10-31 14:10:22,Biden targeted in GOP resolution condemning 'garbage' remark about Trump supporters,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-targeted-gop-resolution-condemning-garbage-remark-about-trump-supporters,Politics,"FIRST ON FOX: President Biden is getting hit with a resolution in Congress condemning his ""garbage"" remarks while discussing former President Donald Trump’s supporters earlier this week.

""President Biden must be condemned for calling millions of Americans who support Donald Trump garbage,"" Rep. John Rose, R-Tenn., who is introducing the measure later this week, told Fox News Digital.

He linked it to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s infamous quip that half of Trump supporters were a ""basket of deplorables"" during her doomed 2016 presidential bid.

TRUMP CALLS FOR SUPPORTS TO ‘FORGIVE’ BIDEN IN SHOW OF UNITY AFTER PRESIDENT CALLS SUPPORTERS ‘GARBAGE’

""First, Democrats called half the country deplorables. Now, they are doubling down, calling us garbage. Democrats’ disrespect for half the country’s views and opinions is exactly what is wrong with the leadership of extreme far-left liberals,"" Rose said.

Republicans have been hammering Biden – and by extension 2024 Democratic nominee Vice President Kamala Harris – over the remarks, even forcing top Democrats to distance themselves from the controversial comment.

The White House has denied that the president called Trump supporters ""garbage,"" and interpretations of what the 81-year-old leader said have been hotly debated.

Biden was asked about Trump’s rally at Madison Square Garden during a virtual call with Voto Latino. Democrats had accused Republicans of racist rhetoric during the event, particularly one of comedian Tony Hinchcliffe’s jokes referring to Puerto Rico as a ""floating island of garbage.""

SLOTKIN SLAMS FELLOW DEM BIDEN FOR ‘GARBAGE’ GAFFE AMID HEATED SENATE BATTLE

He responded by saying, ""Donald Trump has no character. He doesn't give a damn about the Latino community. He's a failed businessman. He only cares about the billionaire friends that he has and accumulating wealth for those at the top.""

""And just the other day, a speaker at his rally called Puerto Rico a ‘floating island of garbage.' Well, let me tell you something…in my home state of Delaware, they're good, decent, honorable people. The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters – his demonization of Latinos is unconscionable, and it's un-American. It's totally contrary to everything we've done, everything we've been,"" Biden said.

White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre insisted Wednesday that he was referring to Hinchcliffe’s joke.

""He does not view Trump supporters or anybody who supports Trump as garbage. That is not what he views,"" she said.

Biden himself posted a similar explanation on X earlier this week.

""His demonization of Latinos is unconscionable. That's all I meant to say. The comments at that rally don't reflect who we are as a nation,"" the post said.

BIDEN CALLS TRUMP SUPPORTERS ‘GARBAGE’ DURING HARRIS CAMPAIGN EVENT AS VP PROMISES UNITY AT ELLIPSE RALLY

However, that has done little to stem the Republican backlash, particularly with Election Day less than a week away.

Trump arrived at his Wednesday campaign stop in Wisconsin in a garbage truck and wore a high-visibility vest throughout his rally.

Vivek Ramaswamy, one of his surrogates, posted a video of himself on the job with sanitation workers.

Harris distanced herself from the comments Wednesday morning, telling reporters, ""I think that, first of all, he clarified his comments. But let me be clear, I strongly disagree with any criticism of people based on who they vote for.""

Rep. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., who is running in one of the most closely watched Senate races in the country, went even further.

""In terms of what President Biden said yesterday, he shouldn’t have said it. I mean, it’s inappropriate. And, for me, I just think that kind of talk is the last thing we need in our politics,"" Slotkin told Michigan radio station WWJ Newsradio.

Could Seoul, Halong Bay, Phnom Penh, or Sapa Be Your Next Adventure?

As 2024 approaches, travel trends indicate a significant shift in global traveler preferences. Recent insights from Tripadvisor reveal that travelers are increasingly drawn to major cities in Asia, moving away from traditional hotspots like London and Paris. This change is highlighted by Tripadvisor’s announcement of its Travelers’ Choice Best of the Best Destination Awards, which ranks the world’s top trending destinations based on the quality and quantity of reviews from global travelers concerning accommodations, restaurants, and activities.

Tokyo: The Top Trending Destination

Among these trends, Tokyo has emerged as the leading travel destination for 2024. Following Japan’s easing of border restrictions post-COVID-19, interest in Tokyo has surged. Reports indicate that Tokyo not only ranks as the top trending destination but also stands out among the top 24 worldwide destinations for non-US travelers, according to data from Airbnb. Notably, Airbnb has observed that search traffic for trips to Japan has more than tripled during the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, marking the largest increase of any country globally.

Seoul: A Rising Star

Seoul has also captured the attention of travelers, securing its place as the second most trending global destination for 2024. Data from market research firm Euromonitor International shows that Seoul was the most visited Asian city in 2023. This growing popularity reflects a broader trend of increased interest in South Korea, showcasing the city’s vibrant culture, innovative technology, and unique culinary scene.

Top 10 Trending Destinations for 2024

The list of top trending global travel destinations for 2024 includes:

Tokyo, Japan Seoul, South Korea Halong Bay, Vietnam Palawan Island, Philippines Sapa, Vietnam Bogota, Colombia Pattaya, Thailand Alajuela, Costa Rica Phnom Penh, Cambodia Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia

This diverse selection underscores travelers’ desire for unique experiences and highlights the appeal of Asia as a leading travel region in the upcoming year.

Impact on the Travel Industry

The trends for 2024 signify a transformative moment in the travel industry. With a noticeable shift toward Asian destinations, several implications arise:

The structure is named the ""House of Phaedra"" after the mythic queen of Athens. It has a well-preserved painting of her displayed on a wall, according to a Pompeii archaeological park press release.

While small in its size, the ""House of Phaedra"" is adorned with refined detailing, with scenes of nature and patterns found throughout the space.

WORLD’S SMALLEST INHABITED ISLAND FEATURES A SINGLE HOME AND TREE

Unlike other Pompeian homes, this building lacks an atrium, which is a central open-air space that collects rainwater, Reuters reported.

The home does have a courtyard with painted red walls. It includes a covered large tub.

Around the tub would have been a canal to allow rainwater to be collected through to a cistern below.

A lararium (shrine) displays painted motifs of birds, branches and snakes at the base with an opening for offerings, creating an altar.

""An elevated element that supports an egg, what would seem to be a fig and a date,"" and a pine cone were found on the altar, according to the press release.

Researchers suggest the last offerings were left before the eruption of Mount Vesuvius volcano in 79 AD that destroyed Pompeii.

A fresco painting depicting Phaedra and Hippolytus was discovered in well-preserved condition.

Phaedra is known for the tale of her love for her stepson that was not reciprocated and ultimately led her to commit suicide and accuse Hippolytus of rape, according to the World History Encyclopedia.

1029,2024-10-29 07:47:49,Centrum Air to Launch Weekly Service from Tashkent to Colombo,https://www.travelandtourworld.com/news/article/centrum-air-to-launch-weekly-service-from-tashkent-to-colombo/,Tourism,"Centrum Air to Launch Weekly Service from Tashkent to Colombo

Centrum Air, Uzbekistan’s rapidly growing airline, has announced a new weekly service between Tashkent and Colombo, Sri Lanka, starting November 17, 2024. This addition marks a significant step in expanding Uzbekistan’s air connectivity to South Asia, providing both leisure and business travelers with a new direct link to the tropical island nation. The route will be operated by Airbus A321neo, known for its fuel efficiency and passenger comfort, aligning with Centrum Air’s commitment to modern and efficient air travel.

Details of the New Tashkent-Colombo Route

The new route, scheduled to operate on Sundays, will depart from Tashkent International Airport (TAS) at 2:40 AM and arrive at Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport (CMB) at 9:10 AM local time. The return flight will leave Colombo at 10:30 AM, reaching Tashkent by 3:40 PM. This schedule offers convenient timing for travelers who wish to maximize their time in Sri Lanka, arriving early in the morning and departing mid-morning for a comfortable return to Tashkent.

Operating the Tashkent-Colombo route with the Airbus A321neo, Centrum Air aims to offer passengers a comfortable and efficient flight experience. The A321neo, a next-generation narrow-body aircraft, boasts reduced fuel consumption and lower emissions, enhancing the airline’s commitment to sustainable aviation practices. With a capacity for around 180 passengers, the A321neo provides ample space and a modern inflight experience, including ergonomic seating and advanced entertainment options.

Expansion of Uzbekistan-Sri Lanka Tourism and Trade

Centrum Air’s new Colombo service is expected to enhance tourism and trade relations between Uzbekistan and Sri Lanka. For Uzbek travelers, Sri Lanka offers a diverse array of attractions, from cultural heritage sites and vibrant cities to scenic beaches and wildlife reserves. The addition of this direct flight is likely to attract a surge in travelers interested in Sri Lanka’s renowned hospitality, cuisine, and unique experiences.

The route is also expected to support bilateral trade

between Uzbekistan and Sri Lanka, facilitating faster and more efficient movement of goods and fostering economic ties. With Colombo being a strategic transit hub in South Asia, Uzbekistan’s businesses now have an expanded gateway to the broader South Asian market. This connectivity is anticipated to promote mutual investments and ease the flow of business travelers between the two countries.

Cancellation of Tashkent-Langkawi Route

Alongside this announcement, Centrum Air has also made changes to its planned winter schedule, notably removing the previously listed Tashkent-Langkawi route, which was set to launch on November 17, 2024. While the specific reasons for this cancellation were not disclosed, the decision may reflect a reallocation of resources towards high-demand markets or a strategic focus on more lucrative routes, such as the new Colombo service. This cancellation allows Centrum Air to streamline its operations, concentrating on routes that align with passenger demand and regional growth opportunities.

Centrum Air’s Growing Network and Strategic Expansion

The launch of the Tashkent-Colombo route is part of Centrum Air’s broader plan to increase its international presence and cater to the rising demand for accessible travel options from Central Asia. As a relatively new player in Uzbekistan’s aviation market, Centrum Air is actively expanding its network to cover key tourist and business destinations across Asia, Europe, and the Middle East. By introducing flights to popular international destinations, Centrum Air is positioning itself as a convenient choice for Uzbek travelers looking for direct routes to exotic locales.

The airline’s decision to utilize the A321neo for its Colombo service is also strategic. The A321neo’s range and efficiency make it an ideal choice for medium-haul routes, allowing Centrum Air to optimize fuel costs while delivering a quality travel experience. For travelers, this means more direct flight options and a comfortable journey that doesn’t compromise on amenities.

Future Outlook and Potential Growth Opportunities

As demand for international travel from Uzbekistan continues to grow, Centrum Air is well-positioned to capture a share of this emerging market. The Tashkent-Colombo route may also pave the way for future expansions into other South Asian and Southeast Asian markets, aligning with the airline’s vision of becoming a prominent carrier in the region. By focusing on underserved routes and leveraging Tashkent as a growing transit hub, Centrum Air could further diversify its network, benefiting both the Uzbek travel industry and international tourism.

This new connection to Sri Lanka aligns well with Uzbekistan’s broader tourism and economic strategies, promoting Uzbekistan as a gateway to Central Asia for international travelers. With the ongoing development of Tashkent’s air travel infrastructure, Centrum Air’s expansion efforts contribute to Uzbekistan’s ambition of establishing itself as a regional aviation hub.

Centrum Air’s new Colombo service offers Uzbek travelers a convenient and direct route to experience the richness of Sri Lanka, and the airline’s continued growth reflects the potential of Uzbekistan’s aviation sector. The airline’s agile response to market trends, coupled with strategic aircraft choices, ensures that Centrum Air remains a competitive and appealing option for international travel, connecting Uzbekistan with the world."

American Airlines has introduced its intercontinental route adjustments for the Winter 2024/25 season, set to begin on October 27, 2024. The airline’s revised schedule includes aircraft swaps, seasonal route suspensions, and changes in flight frequencies across major international destinations to optimize operations in response to fluctuating demand.

Key Route and Aircraft Changes

In response to passenger demand on transatlantic routes, American Airlines is updating aircraft and flight frequencies on select European routes from Dallas/Ft. Worth (DFW), Charlotte (CLT), and New York JFK. For instance, the Charlotte-London Heathrow route will switch from a Boeing 777-200ER to a larger 777-300ER on one of its three daily flights starting November 5, 2024. The DFW-Paris route will see a mix of 787-8 and 777-200ER operations during different periods, with seasonal adjustments to align with peak travel dates.

Similarly, flights from Los Angeles (LAX) to London Heathrow will be reduced from three to two daily, with aircraft switching from the 777-300ER to the 777-200ER. The New York JFK to London Heathrow route will also experience a capacity reduction, with overall flights dropping from 594 to 563 for the season.

Expansions and Service Suspensions in South America

American Airlines will resume its DFW-Rio de Janeiro route, a daily 787-8 service, marking the route’s return since February 2018. Additionally, a seasonal increase in service is planned for Miami-Montevideo, which will see frequencies rise from three to seven flights per week between December 19, 2024, and February 12, 2025.

However, certain routes to South America will experience reductions. The Miami-Rio de Janeiro route will operate three times weekly instead of daily, except for peak holiday dates.

Changes in Asia-Pacific Services

For its Asia-Pacific network, American Airlines will maintain two daily 787-8 flights from Los Angeles to Tokyo Haneda, a shift from the previously scheduled 787-9. The DFW-Tokyo Narita route will transition to a daily 777-200ER, replacing the former 787-8 service, while the DFW-Seoul Incheon route will see similar adjustments with the 777-200ER replacing the 787-9. The New York JFK-Tokyo Haneda route will switch to a 787-9, offering enhanced passenger capacity and comfort.

Seasonal Suspensions and Frequency Reductions

Certain European routes from Philadelphia (PHL), including flights to Amsterdam, Paris Charles de Gaulle, Rome, and Zurich, will be either suspended or reduced in frequency during January and February 2025. Additionally, American Airlines has confirmed the cancellation of its Phoenix-London Heathrow route for the entire winter season.

As American Airlines adjusts its winter schedule, the airline aims to balance operational efficiency with passenger needs, ensuring resource optimization across its intercontinental network. By strategically reallocating aircraft and adjusting frequencies, American Airlines is set to meet the shifting demand for travel across key international destinations."

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) is preparing to integrate digital currencies into its financial settlement systems, marking a significant step toward modernizing transaction methods in the aviation industry. The first digital currency to be introduced will be the digital Renminbi (e-CNY), available in IATA’s China Billing and Settlement Plan (BSP) by the end of 2024. This initiative aims to support the evolving payment preferences of airlines and customers in one of the world’s most digitally progressive markets.

“Digitalization impacts many aspects of our daily lives, including the currency we use,” said Muhammad Albakri, IATA’s Senior Vice President for Financial Settlement and Distribution Services. “With the increasing use of digital currencies, it is imperative that IATA’s industry financial settlement systems adapt to support the needs of those using our services.”

China’s rapid adoption of digital currency led IATA’s China Airline Committee to request the integration of the digital Renminbi in the BSP. This development marks a proactive step by IATA to accommodate the changing financial landscape in the Chinese market, providing airlines with greater flexibility in their financial transactions. “This is an important development, and IATA will accommodate the digital Renminbi by year-end,” Albakri added.

Beyond the digital Renminbi, IATA is exploring the potential for other digital currencies to be incorporated into its settlement systems, based on industry needs and global demand. According to Albakri, the experience gained from the digital Renminbi rollout will inform the process for introducing additional digital currencies in the future.

In addition to the digital Renminbi, IATA has already taken steps to enhance its currency handling capabilities. In July 2024, IATA introduced the Renminbi Offshore (CNH) currency to its IATA Currency Clearance Service (ICCS), bringing the total currencies handled by the ICCS to 74. The ICCS is a global cash management system designed to facilitate currency repatriation and streamline financial transactions for airlines. This service improves airlines’ working capital management by accelerating the conversion of sales funds to preferred currencies and mitigating foreign exchange risks.

Albakri emphasized that the decision to integrate digital currencies is rooted in IATA’s commitment to enhancing customer satisfaction and ensuring airlines receive the proper value from their ticket sales. “A customer shouldn’t be frustrated by not having their payment method of choice available. Nor should airlines lose out on deriving the proper value from their ticket sales,” he explained.

By offering digital currency options, IATA aims to make payments seamless, flexible, and in line with the digital transformation seen in other industries. As digital payment trends continue to grow globally, IATA’s move to introduce the digital Renminbi and potentially other digital currencies positions the organization at the forefront of financial innovation in the aviation industry. This forward-looking approach is set to benefit airlines and customers alike, creating a more adaptable and resilient financial ecosystem within the global aviation sector."

Vietnam is moving forward with plans for a monumental $67-billion high-speed railway project and has invited China State Construction Engineering Corporation (CSCEC) to participate. The invitation was extended by Vietnam’s Commission for the Management of State Capital at Enterprises (CMSC), signaling a new phase of cross-border collaboration aimed at enhancing infrastructure and connectivity in the region.

CMSC Vice Chairman Nguyen Ngoc Canh highlighted CSCEC’s extensive experience in managing large-scale infrastructure projects, particularly in Vietnam, at a recent meeting with CSCEC representatives. The high-speed railway project, intended to span the length of the country, aligns with a broader bilateral vision between Vietnam and China to improve infrastructure connectivity across borders. Following the joint statement from Vietnam’s Party General Secretary To Lam’s visit to China in August, the two countries have pledged to enhance connectivity through improved roadways, railways, gateways, and smart customs facilities.

For the railway segment, Vietnam plans not only to invest in building the North-South high-speed railway but also to upgrade three crucial standard-gauge routes: Lao Cai-Hanoi-Hai Phong, Lang Son-Hanoi, and Mong Cai-Ha Long-Hai Phong. These routes will be developed to interconnect with China’s existing rail network, enabling smoother transit for both passengers and cargo across the region.

Jin Shuo, head of international project management at CSCEC, expressed enthusiasm for CSCEC’s potential role in these projects. He affirmed the corporation’s commitment to meeting Vietnam’s high standards in terms of timeline and quality, as well as the willingness to share expertise. As one of the world’s largest construction firms, CSCEC has a proven track record in executing complex projects, which could be instrumental in ensuring the successful delivery of Vietnam’s ambitious rail project.

Vietnam intends to break ground on the first two sections of the North-South high-speed railway by late 2027. The 1,541-kilometer railway will have a designed speed of 350 kilometers per hour, with 23 passenger stations and five cargo stations strategically located near key industrial hubs. Once completed, the railway is expected to significantly reduce travel time across the country and support economic growth by facilitating efficient transportation of goods.

While the project is open to foreign partnerships, Deputy Minister of Transport Nguyen Danh Huy emphasized that Vietnam will primarily rely on domestic resources, minimizing dependencies on external entities to maintain control over this critical infrastructure initiative. This self-reliant approach underlines Vietnam’s commitment to safeguarding national interests while still benefiting from foreign expertise and investment.

The North-South high-speed railway is not just a significant transportation project; it represents a step towards modernizing Vietnam’s infrastructure and bolstering its strategic position within Southeast Asia. By partnering with companies like CSCEC, Vietnam hopes to deliver a world-class rail network that will cater to both domestic mobility needs and regional connectivity goals, setting a new benchmark for infrastructure in the region."

Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Tourism recently issued a reminder stressing the importance of proper licensing for tourism facilities, aiming to maintain high standards of quality, safety, and professionalism across the hospitality industry. In an announcement intended for investors and tourism operators, the Ministry clarified that operating without a valid license will result in financial penalties, which will increase for repeated violations. This push for compliance underlines Saudi Arabia’s commitment to its tourism development goals as part of Vision 2030, highlighting the Ministry’s dedication to fostering a well-regulated tourism landscape.

Licensing and Compliance: A Prerequisite for Tourism Operations

The Ministry’s message serves as a directive to all hospitality operators, requiring them to secure the necessary licenses before launching tourism-related activities. By enforcing strict regulations, the Ministry aims to promote high operational standards that align with the country’s expanding tourism infrastructure and visitor expectations. Facilities found operating without licenses risk financial penalties, and the fines will be doubled for any subsequent breaches of these requirements.

The enforcement of licensing is also a step toward standardizing the industry, ensuring that all tourism facilities meet the Ministry’s criteria for quality and safety. This move sets a clear expectation that investors and facility managers must adhere to a uniform standard, creating a foundation for a reliable and competitive tourism sector.

Common Violations and Consequences for Tourism Facilities

In addition to enforcing licenses, the Ministry’s inspection teams conduct regular control and inspection tours to monitor compliance across various hospitality facilities. These inspections have revealed several common violations, including the distribution of promotional materials that fail to meet Ministry standards, incomplete or incorrect classification certificates, and issues with cleanliness and maintenance. The Ministry reported instances where managers did not provide essential contact information in reception areas and where licenses had expired or were invalid.

These identified shortcomings demonstrate the importance of maintaining high operational standards to enhance the visitor experience. By addressing these specific issues, the Ministry aims to protect tourists’ interests while ensuring that the facilities align with the high expectations associated with Saudi Arabia’s tourism industry.

Key Compliance Areas Highlighted by the Ministry:

Valid Licensing: All tourism facilities must possess a valid, Ministry-approved license to operate legally.

All tourism facilities must possess a valid, Ministry-approved license to operate legally. Promotional Integrity: Promotional materials must accurately reflect the facility’s classification and standards.

Promotional materials must accurately reflect the facility’s classification and standards. Visitor Support: Contact information for the manager on duty must be accessible in reception areas.

Contact information for the manager on duty must be accessible in reception areas. Facility Maintenance: Regular upkeep and cleanliness of the property are mandatory for a safe and enjoyable visitor experience.

Campaign for Hospitality Standards and Visitor Engagement

To encourage tourism facilities to adhere to licensing and classification standards, the Ministry of Tourism launched a campaign aimed at promoting compliance. This initiative urges operators to consistently uphold standards in line with national tourism regulations, further enhancing Saudi Arabia’s appeal as a travel destination. The campaign also empowers visitors to report any issues or seek clarification regarding services by contacting the Ministry’s unified tourism center at 930 or through its official social media channels.

By fostering direct engagement between the Ministry and the public, this campaign represents a transparent and responsive approach to tourism management. Visitors are encouraged to voice their concerns, allowing the Ministry to address service issues promptly and hold facilities accountable. This approach to open communication demonstrates the Ministry’s dedication to cultivating a tourism ecosystem that prioritizes visitor satisfaction and safety.

The Broader Impact on Saudi Arabia’s Tourism Industry

The Ministry’s emphasis on licensing and compliance is a significant step in Saudi Arabia’s journey to establish itself as a premier travel destination. With Vision 2030 as a guiding framework, the country is rapidly transforming its tourism landscape, attracting investments in luxury hotels, eco-tourism, cultural heritage sites, and entertainment venues. By enforcing stringent regulations on tourism facilities, the Ministry seeks to ensure that these establishments contribute positively to the country’s reputation and meet the standards expected by international travelers.

Ensuring that tourism facilities are licensed and compliant directly impacts the visitor experience by guaranteeing that services adhere to a defined standard. For travelers, this means they can trust that licensed facilities meet cleanliness, maintenance, and operational criteria, fostering a sense of security and reliability. As a result, Saudi Arabia’s tourism sector can be expected to gain greater recognition as a well-regulated and tourist-friendly destination, attracting a diverse range of visitors.

Global Implications for Tourism Compliance and Quality Standards

Saudi Arabia’s focus on licensing within its tourism industry reflects a growing trend globally, where governments are implementing tighter regulations to enhance the quality of visitor services. This approach is not only beneficial to domestic tourism but also encourages international standards that impact the global tourism industry. For example, clear guidelines and rigorous enforcement mechanisms are crucial for creating safe and pleasant environments for tourists, a standard increasingly demanded by international travelers.

Other countries may observe and adopt similar measures, particularly those experiencing rapid tourism growth. By setting an example of compliance and transparency, Saudi Arabia is contributing to a broader dialogue within the tourism sector about the importance of regulatory oversight. This, in turn, sets a foundation for sustainable tourism practices that prioritize quality over quantity, aligning with the evolving expectations of the modern traveler.

The Future of Tourism in Saudi Arabia: Quality and Compliance at the Core

The Ministry of Tourism’s commitment to maintaining licensed, high-standard facilities demonstrates a proactive approach to managing Saudi Arabia’s tourism sector. This focus on compliance is likely to support the long-term objectives of Vision 2030, which include welcoming more international tourists and developing tourism as a key economic pillar. As more hospitality facilities align with these standards, the consistency in quality will likely become a distinctive feature of Saudi Arabia’s tourism offerings.

The licensing initiative also contributes to Saudi Arabia’s broader tourism goals by ensuring that the facilities in place provide a memorable and seamless experience for visitors. Compliance with Ministry standards will allow the sector to expand sustainably, attracting travelers seeking a reliable and quality-driven destination. The Ministry’s actions highlight the importance of fostering a well-regulated tourism sector that prioritizes the needs and safety of visitors, setting a high bar for other emerging tourism markets worldwide.

As Saudi Arabia continues to grow as a travel destination, maintaining stringent licensing requirements and operational standards will position the country as a leader in regulated, high-quality tourism. With increased transparency, open communication channels, and a commitment to compliance, Saudi Arabia’s tourism industry is poised to offer travelers a secure, reliable, and enriching experience, thereby boosting the country’s appeal on the international stage."

The Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) has brought back its Pimpri-Chinchwad tourism bus service just in time for Diwali, offering residents and visitors the chance to explore the area’s historical and religious landmarks. This festive season relaunch aims to connect travelers with the region’s rich cultural heritage.

Initially introduced in May 2023, the service encountered low demand, resulting in a scaled-back schedule and eventually, a complete pause in operations. With an anticipated rise in tourists during Diwali, PMPML has resumed the service, hoping to make local tourism more accessible and enjoyable.

In its previous run, the service operated from Nigdi depot on weekends, covering popular destinations like Dehu, Alandi, and Prati-Shirdi Shirgaon. Aiming for at least 35 passengers per trip, PMPML initially struggled with low turnout. Now, in response to public feedback and seasonal demand, the service has been expanded to seven major destinations around Pune, placing special emphasis on landmarks within Pimpri-Chinchwad.

Key Details of the Service

Tickets for the “Pimpri-Chinchwad Darshan” bus service are available at designated centers across Nigdi, Bhosari, and Lokhande Bhavan in Pimpri. Operating daily from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m., the service provides a comprehensive day tour of the area’s iconic sites, offering a deep dive into its historical and cultural significance.

While the service promises convenience, some residents have raised concerns over ticket prices, suggesting that higher costs might affect overall ridership. PMPML is aware of these concerns and remains optimistic that the tourism service will draw a significant number of passengers, particularly from neighboring areas during the holiday season.

Designed to offer an immersive experience, the Pimpri-Chinchwad tourism bus service strives to provide a seamless and enriching journey through the area’s most celebrated sites, fostering a greater appreciation for the region’s heritage and vibrant culture."

Mysuru tourism industry stakeholders have raised concerns over the recent decision to increase entry fees for foreign visitors to Mysuru Palace from ₹100 to ₹1,000. Many fear that this steep hike could further diminish the already declining international visitor numbers to the iconic site. Over the past decade, Mysuru Palace has seen a notable drop in foreign tourists, prompting local hotel owners and travel agents to express apprehension about the potential impact of the fee increase.

Industry representatives argue that the fee hike was implemented without consulting tourism professionals. Many feel that a more gradual increase would have been more reasonable, especially during a time when foreign tourism is already experiencing a downturn. Travel agents warn that the new fee structure could place a financial strain on group travel arrangements, as previous packages were priced based on the old entry rate. Sudden cost hikes may also make Mysuru less appealing to large tour groups.

Tourism advocates suggest that any increase in fees should coincide with visible improvements in facilities, such as enhanced parking and sanitation, to justify the additional cost. Without such upgrades, the elevated fees might drive tourists toward more affordable regional alternatives, particularly in a market where rising travel and accommodation expenses are already influencing decisions.

On the other hand, officials defending the increase assert that the revised fee is still relatively low compared to entry charges at major international tourist sites, where visitors often pay significantly more. They believe that, due to favorable currency exchange rates, the higher fee will not deter foreign visitors from including Mysuru Palace in their itineraries.

Despite these reassurances, local residents remain concerned that the new pricing could deter international visitors, especially as the tourism sector is still recovering. Historical data highlights these worries, revealing a sharp decline in foreign visitors to Mysuru Palace, from over 80,000 in 2012-13 to just around 11,000 so far this year."

Uttarakhand is on the path to becoming India’s premier birdwatching destination, with efforts underway to elevate this activity into a large-scale tourism attraction. The state already offers over 15 recognized birdwatching sites, and the Forest Department is actively working to introduce even more locations, creating a network of birding hotspots for enthusiasts across India.

While birdwatching is a popular tourism segment worldwide, Uttarakhand is leading the way in making this niche more prominent in India’s travel offerings. Recently, the state hosted a three-day bird festival from October 18 to 20 in the Binov area of the Mussoorie Sanctuary, attracting bird lovers from every corner of the country and celebrating the region’s vibrant birdlife.

Globally, countries like the United Kingdom, Germany, and the Netherlands have well-developed birdwatching tourism industries, while the U.S. market is valued at approximately $8 billion annually. As India’s birdwatching community grows—projected to increase from 45,000 enthusiasts to nearly 20 million by 2025—Uttarakhand is positioning itself to be a leader in this sector.

Uttarakhand is home to 268 of the 762 bird species found across India, making it one of the richest regions for bird diversity, second only to Maharashtra. Leveraging this biodiversity, the Forest Department plans to make birdwatching a central attraction by developing new sites across the state.

With sustainability in mind, the Forest Department is promoting ethical birdwatching practices, discouraging behaviors that could harm these habitats, such as disturbing nests, feeding birds unnatural food, or playing loud sounds. Volunteers and birding advocates nationwide are encouraged to join in promoting these responsible practices.

Uttarakhand’s rich array of bird species and dedication to sustainable tourism make it a promising new hub for birdwatchers, poised to attract both avid bird enthusiasts and environmentally conscious travelers."

Nestled in the heart of Northeast India, Guwahati thrives as a vibrant gateway, with the majestic Brahmaputra River flowing through its core. This river is not merely a natural landmark; it embodies the very essence of the city. I fondly recall childhood days spent by its sandy banks, where the excitement of playing beach cricket mingled with the tranquil sounds of water, crafting memories that linger like the river’s gentle current.

Yet, the Brahmaputra is a river of striking contrasts. With the onset of the monsoon, its placid surface transforms into a turbulent torrent, inundating many riverside communities in Assam. This annual cycle of flooding poses significant challenges, despite the continuous efforts of local authorities and environmentalists striving to mitigate its effects.

The name “Assam” is thought to be derived from the Sanskrit word ‘soma,’ which signifies ‘peerless’ or ‘unmatched.’ Located just south of the eastern Himalayas, Assam is blessed by the presence of the Brahmaputra, revered as the son of Bhagwan Brahma. This connection perhaps explains why the river is regarded as the only male river in India, symbolizing resilience and strength.

Historically, the lush expanse of the Brahmaputra Valley was untouched by outside forces until the decline of the Ahoms in the nineteenth century. This shift marked the beginning of a new era, starting with the Burmese invasion and swiftly followed by British colonial rule after their victory in the first Anglo-Burmese War in 1826. This transition transformed the region into a vital economic hub for British India, particularly following the discovery of Asia’s first oil wells at Digboi. As a result, Assam emerged as the world’s leading tea-producing region, cementing its significance in the global economy.

In essence, the Brahmaputra is not just a river; it is the lifeblood of Assam, intricately woven into the cultural, historical, and economic tapestry of the region. Its waters shape the lives of those who dwell along its banks, standing as a powerful reminder of nature’s beauty and the complexity of human existence."

Malaysia medical tourism industry is making a remarkable comeback after the COVID-19 pandemic, emerging as one of the top healthcare destinations globally. Known for its affordable and high-quality medical treatments, Malaysia is positioning itself as a leader in medical tourism, with patients from around the world seeking care in its state-of-the-art facilities. The industry, which had faced a significant downturn during the pandemic, is now seeing growth as healthcare travelers return in large numbers.

The country’s ability to provide top-tier healthcare services at competitive prices has made it a popular choice for patients from regions like Indonesia, China, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Australia, and beyond. According to the Malaysia Healthcare Travel Council (MHTC), Malaysia is leveraging its reputation for quality healthcare to attract international patients, with particular emphasis on specialized treatments such as cardiology, orthopedics, cosmetic surgery, and cancer care.

In 2019, Malaysia generated over RM1.7 billion (approximately $406 million) from medical tourism, with key markets including Indonesia and China. While the pandemic slowed growth, Malaysia’s proactive efforts in public-private partnerships have helped the sector recover quickly. In 2022, the medical tourism industry nearly returned to its pre-pandemic levels, generating RM726 million by the third quarter alone, indicating robust recovery.

Key Medical Tourism Hubs

Penang and Melaka remain the top hotspots for medical tourists, particularly from Indonesia, who account for over 70% of healthcare arrivals in these regions. With their world-class hospitals and clinics, these cities offer a variety of treatments, including reconstructive surgery, neurosurgery, and comprehensive wellness programs.

Penang is currently transforming into a global medical tourism hub, attracting significant investments to improve its healthcare infrastructure. The state’s focus on high-end treatments, such as robotic surgery, coupled with affordable pricing, has drawn patients from all over Southeast Asia and beyond.

Key Attractions for Medical Tourists

Several factors contribute to Malaysia’s appeal as a medical tourism destination. These include:

Affordability: Malaysia offers some of the most competitive healthcare prices globally, often at a fraction of the cost compared to the U.S. or Europe. Patients benefit from low-cost procedures without compromising on quality. Advanced Healthcare Facilities: Malaysia is home to internationally accredited hospitals equipped with cutting-edge medical technology and highly trained professionals. The nation’s healthcare system has been praised for its patient-centric approach, offering a seamless and stress-free experience for international visitors. Diverse Range of Treatments: From cosmetic surgeries and dental procedures to complex treatments like neurosurgery and oncology, Malaysia caters to a wide array of medical needs. The nation’s strong focus on preventative care and wellness has also positioned it as a prime destination for health-conscious travelers. Multilingual Healthcare Services: English is widely spoken across the healthcare sector, making communication easier for international patients. Additionally, healthcare providers often have multilingual staff to cater to patients from various parts of the world.

Future Growth and Development

Malaysia’s government and industry stakeholders continue to collaborate to ensure that the country remains at the forefront of medical tourism. Initiatives like the Malaysia Healthcare Travel Industry Blueprint (2021-2025) aim to further promote the nation as a leading healthcare destination. Efforts to expand in secondary markets like Hong Kong, Vietnam, Singapore, and Australia, as well as continuing investment in healthcare technology, are crucial steps toward this goal.

The success of Malaysia’s healthcare travel industry has also created significant spillover effects, generating employment and promoting the country’s tourism sector. With a rise in wellness tourism, including offerings like comprehensive health screening packages and rejuvenation programs, Malaysia is tapping into the growing global demand for health and wellness vacations.

The road ahead looks promising, with experts predicting that Malaysia’s medical tourism will continue to grow and contribute significantly to the national economy. As the world looks for affordable, quality healthcare options, Malaysia’s position as a safe, trusted, and advanced destination for medical travelers is solidifying."

Following a four-month hiatus, Papikondalu tourism has reopened just in time for Diwali, drawing eager visitors to experience its breathtaking natural beauty. This much-anticipated revival has reenergized the area, with tourists flocking to take in the picturesque landscapes of Papikondalu.

The Gandipochamma boat point was alive with energy as tourists assembled for a scenic boat ride along the tranquil Godavari River.

The event, which was first-come, first-serve, sold out within hours of being announced.

The 19,500-seat venue is home of the New York Knicks and New York Rangers.

The Trump campaign says the program includes political icons, celebrities, musical artists, and friends and family of former President Trump who will all discuss how he is ""the best choice to fix everything that Kamala Harris broke.""

ELON MUSK, DANA WHITE TO APPEAR AT 'HISTORIC' TRUMP MSG RALLY

""This epic event, in the heart of President Trump's home city, will be a showcase of the historic political movement that President Trump has built in the final days of the campaign,"" the campaign said in a press release.

Elon Musk and Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) CEO Dana White will attend the rally Sunday.

Musk has already hit the campaign trail for Trump, delivering a memorable speech in Butler, Pennsylvania , earlier this month, when the former president returned to the same site where an assassination attempt was made on his life on July 13.

White, who has been a close friend of Trump for years and played a role in him reestablishing the mixed martial arts company in the early 2000s, introduced the former president at this year’s Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, telling the crowd the stakes have never been higher .

Other notable attendees this Sunday include former Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, political commentator Tucker Carlson and former Democrat presidential nominee turned Republican Tulsi Gabbard.

High-profile names from the political world include Republican vice-presidential candidate JD Vance, Speaker Mike Johnson, Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., and Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla.

TRUMP TO HOLD RALLY AT NEW YORK'S MADISON SQUARE GARDEN AHEAD OF ELECTION DAY

Republican National Committee Co-Chair Lara Trump as well as the former president’s sons Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. will also feature.

From the music world, Death Row Records founder Michael Harris Jr. is set to appear, as will singer Lee Greenwood and opera singer Christopher Macchio.

The Garden hosted the Republican National Convention (RNC) in 2004 and the Democratic National Convention (DNC) in 1924, 1976, 1980 and 1992.

Then-President Ronald Reagan, in his 1984 re-election landslide, was the last Republican to carry New York in a White House race.

""We're making a play for New Jersey. We're making a play for Virginia,"" Trump said at a rally earlier this month, before adding that he's also aiming to compete in Minnesota and New Mexico.

Earlier this year, during a campaign stop at an Upper Manhattan bodega, Trump said he would ""straighten out New York.""

""We're going to come in — number one, you have to stop crime, and we're going to let the police do their job. They have to be given back their authority. They have to be able to do their job,"" Trump said. ""And we're going to come into New York. We're making a big play for New York, other cities, too. But this city, I love this city.""

This will be Trump’s second big rally in the state of New York.

Trump held a rally at the Nassau Coliseum in Uniondale, Long Island, last month. More than 60,000 tickets were requested, far exceeding the venue's 16,000-seat capacity. Thousands of supporters who were not admitted to the venue watched him speak on large screens outside.

TRUMP ADVISER UNPACKS WHY FORMER PRESIDENT IS HOLDING RALLY IN DEEP-BLUE STATE WEEKS FROM ELECTION

Trump also held a rally in the Bronx over the summer at Crotona Park, which had a permit allowance of 3,500 people. The New York Post reported the Bronx rally drew up to 10,000 supporters.

Meanwhile, more than 20,000 people attended his second rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, over the weekend.

The campaign also said they saw more than 100,000 people at the former president’s rally in Wildwood, New Jersey, in May.

Trump previously said New York has ""gotten so bad in the last three years, four years.""

""And we're going to straighten New York out. So running for president, we're putting a big hit in New York — we could win New York,"" Trump said.

""It's got to be super, super close,"" Jason Torchinsky, partner at Holtzman Vogel, told Fox News Digital. ""If you look at the history of post-election litigation, the only places where it has been successfully outcome-determinative really are in places where the vote is just super close.""

""If there's a real issue, the Court will take it. If it's something that the Court doesn't think merits a higher-level view, then they'll summarily affirm,"" Torchinsky said.

Congress amended the Electoral Count Reform Act in 2022 (ECRA) which expedites potential litigation and specifies that the vice president's role during the joint session is ""ministerial in nature.""

'IDEOLOGICAL BALANCE': SUPREME COURT'S CONSERVATIVE MAJORITY TO STAY NO MATTER WHO WINS ELECTION, EXPERTS SAY

The statute says that ""any action brought by an aggrieved candidate for President or Vice President"" will be heard by a district court with a three-judge panel. It is then ""the duty of the court to advance on the docket and to expedite to the greatest possible extent the disposition of the action.""

HARRIS ENTERTAINS SUPREME COURT-PACKING QUESTION DURING TOWN HALL, SUPPORTS 'SOME KIND OF REFORM'

Parties are then allowed to directly request review of the decision by the U.S. Supreme Court on an expedited basis.

""It does kind of create a new route into the federal court for a specific limited set of issues being raised under the Electoral Count Act,"" said Greg Teufel, founder of OGC Law. ""There are very limited issues that can be raised under that Act, though. So it's not a broad expansion or increase in the likelihood of litigation, either in federal courts or litigation that reaches the U.S. Supreme Court, under the Electoral Reform Act.""

Teufel noted that for an election case to be taken up by the Court, ""there would have to be significant and provable fraud allegations or other serious violations of the law in the manner that elections are conducted or votes are processed.""

Republicans and Democrats alike have initiated a flurry of election-related lawsuits ahead of Nov. 5, including a recent Georgia case finding that county election officials must certify results by the legal deadline despite suspecting fraud or mistakes.

Joseph Burns, partner at Holtzman Vogel, did note that Republicans may prove successful in election litigation based on the makeup of the Court.

""In terms of the makeup of the court, there's no question you've got six appointees of Republican judges at this point,"" Burns said. ""And these are generally people who, I think, are going to interpret what needs to be interpreted, whether it's a state statute or a federal statute. Their general philosophy is to adhere as closely as possible to the words of the statute.""

""You have a more conservative-minded Supreme Court in that respect,"" Burns continued. ""And you certainly have Republicans generally making those types of arguments about courts interpreting statutes or state constitutions, for instance, in a stricter manner. So I think in that respect, given the arguments that each side generally makes, Republicans would be in better shape.""

ANONYMOUS GOP SENATOR CONCERNED ABOUT GRASSLEY, 91, RECLAIMING KEY JUDICIARY COMMITTEE CHAIR: REPORT

John Hardin Young, counsel at Sandler Reiff, however, told Fox News Digital he believes it is highly unlikely that the Supreme Court could decide the 2024 election, especially noting the conservative majority.

""I think that there's now a sensitivity among the nine justices not to get involved unless it were absolutely necessary,"" Young said. ""There is, I think, somewhat of a bias in the majority on the Supreme Court to get involved if they believe that process is being corrupted or people who aren't following the rules because the majority is, I think, very sensitive to democracy depending on people following the rules.""

""There are just so many unknowns that we have to see how things play out,"" said Jeff Wice, professor at New York Law School.

Although the ECRA attempted to clarify and revise the casting and counting of electoral votes, Teufel said the law as a whole could become the target of litigation after Nov. 5.

""The entirety of the act may come under challenge if it's utilized in a way that impacts the outcome of the election in a way that people view as improper, unfair or unlawful,"" Teufel said. ""Either side disappointed with how the electoral count goes could raise constitutional questions about the laws used and the process used to count the votes."""

(RIG) Went Bankrupt But The Stock Rebounded Dramatically From Those Lows’,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jim-cramer-says-transocean-ltd-074818275.html,Politics,"We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer on Tesla and Other Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Transocean Ltd. (NYSE:RIG) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer is talking about.

Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money, emphasized the ongoing significance of fossil fuels in supporting technological advancements, even as investments in renewable energy continue to increase. He stated:

“This is not just a grudge match between the old and the new, a battle of electric vehicles versus internal combustion. The truth is, fossil fuels are essential for a lot more than vehicles, like it or not.”

READ ALSO Jim Cramer is Talking About These 12 Stocks and Jim Cramer’s Latest Stock Picks

Cramer highlighted the growing energy demands of major tech companies, noting that the data centers they are constructing consume vast amounts of electricity. While these tech giants are making substantial investments in nuclear energy, he pointed out that this power source is unlikely to significantly impact data centers for at least another decade due to the complexities of building nuclear facilities and community resistance to having them nearby.

“If we need more energy, we’re going to get it from what comes out of the ground … fossil fuels that will power the data center, specifically natural gas… You may be reluctant to invest in it, you might think who cares, but you need to know how vital all of this fossil fuel technology is to the growth of the Magnificent Seven.”

Cramer also reflected on the shift in the U.S. energy landscape, recalling how the nation was once heavily reliant on OPEC for oil imports just two decades ago. Today, he pointed out, the U.S. produces over 13 million barrels per day, making it the largest oil producer globally and a net exporter. He mentioned the Permian Basin's unexpected resilience, continually producing despite earlier predictions of depletion.

Cramer noted that the decline of OPEC has transformed the geopolitical landscape. He referenced the 1973 oil crisis, triggered by OPEC's retaliation against U.S. support for Israel, which led to stagflation and economic turmoil. In contrast, he pointed out that despite Israel's current conflict, the U.S. economy is not experiencing stagflation or recession, resulting instead in a bull market. He attributed this stability to the industry, saying:

“... This industry that spent billions upon billions of dollars to try to be as low carbon as possible is the reason why oil prices have actually come down during this period. They've gotten so much production that OPEC is now powerless.”

I spent 25 years serving our country in uniform rising to full colonel. Like hundreds of thousands of soldiers of my generation, I left my family to deploy to the Iraq War. As an immigrant, my career was the embodiment of the American dream. I went from an infantry officer in the 82nd Airborne leading paratroopers, to a prosecutor protecting service members from sexual predators, to deputy legal adviser on the White House National Security Council. My service has been the honor of my life.

My wife of 26 years, Cindy, has been there every step of the way. Our kids go to public schools and we have been blessed to raise our family here in the commonwealth.

I’m an optimist — and I see good things happening in our community — but times are tough and politicians in Washington aren’t getting the job done.

That’s why I’m running for Congress: to lower costs for families, deliver infrastructure to our community, and to stand up to extremism. I am fiercely independent and driven by morals, ethics and a devotion to the rule of law, which is why two former Republican Congressional Representatives from Virginia have endorsed me.

Conversely, extremists like my opponent’s bankrollers support Project 2025 and have plans to gut public education; further restrict women's reproductive health care; fire government experts and replace them with political lackeys; and cut benefits to retirees, military families and veterans.

Voters in this district are smart. They can see the stark choice between a dishonest extremist committed to taking away people’s rights and a local dad, veteran and recognized expert who will work with both parties to get the job.

It seems that the polarization between parties has reached an all-time high, leading to gridlock and a lack of productive dialogue. This division not only hampers effective governance but also alienates many citizens who feel their voices are not being heard.

Political parties should serve as a bridge between the government and the people, facilitating communication and compromise. However, the focus has shifted toward winning at all costs, often at the expense of the public good. This adversarial approach undermines trust in our political system and discourages civic engagement.

I applaud the Democratic ticket of Eugene Vindman (candidate for Congressional District 7), Tim Kaine (senator) and Kamala Harris (president) and Tim Walz (vice president) as trying to move America away from partisan politics and reaching out to every American. I've seen many ads from Republicans that the saying ""Democracy is at stake"" is hyperbole, but I fear that if we lose sight of what's important about America (her diversity, her freedom, her heart and soul) that we will truly spiral toward a country that we will not want to live in.

I urge my fellow citizens to demand more from our elected officials. Let us advocate for a political culture that values cooperation over conflict and solutions over stalemates. Together, we can create a more inclusive and effective political system. Hate Doesn't Make America Great (HDMA) should be everyone's hat slogan.

“What for?” Anthony recalled asking him.

“To arrest you,” he replied.
